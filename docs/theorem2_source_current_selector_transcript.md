# Theorem 2 Source-Current Selector Transcript

Status: focused live transcript for the two remaining source-current holes in
`BHW.os45CommonEdge_localFigure24DifferenceGerm_of_OSI45`.

This note is not a new theorem surface and not a closure declaration.  Its
purpose is to make the direct producer body Lean-facing before returning to
Lean.  The implementation should expand these steps as local `have`s inside
the Hdiff producer, except for neutral analytic/topological helpers that do
not mention `Hdiff`, `Word`, `Wadj`, zero-height equality, or theorem 2.

## Latest Delta

Lean now checks the ordinary path-to-`Aext` retargeting packet.  The moving
source path chart and moving Wick path chart have both been transported to the
same source-side weight against the explicit endpoint extension charts:

```lean
let WickA0extMoving : Real -> Complex := ...

have hSourcePath_to_A1ext_moving :
    SourcePathMoving =ᶠ[nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0)] SourceMovingSide

have hWickPath_to_A0ext_moving :
    WickPathMoving =ᶠ[nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0)] WickA0extMoving
```

This gives the checked equivalence:

```lean
have hpath_Aext_transport_equiv :
    Tendsto (fun eps => SourcePathMoving eps - WickPathMoving eps)
      (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0)) (nhds 0) <->
    Tendsto (fun eps => SourceMovingSide eps - WickA0extMoving eps)
      (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0)) (nhds 0)
```

The endpoint packet was also retargeted:

```lean
have hWickA0extMoving_selected :
    Tendsto WickA0extMoving (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0))
      (nhds (OS.S n pieceZD))

have hAext_moving_endpoint_gap :
    Tendsto (fun eps => SourceMovingSide eps - WickA0extMoving eps)
      (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0))
      (nhds
        ((∫ u, A1ext.branch (OrdSourceApproach 0 u) * piece u) -
          OS.S n pieceZD))
```

The remaining ordinary leaf is therefore no longer a bare finite-chain chart
comparison.  It is the direct local boundary-value/current transport between
the A1 endpoint branch and the A0 Wick branch with the same moving side-zero
test:

```lean
Tendsto (fun eps => SourceMovingSide eps - WickA0extMoving eps)
  (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0)) (nhds 0)
```

Fresh exact check:
`lake env lean -DmaxHeartbeats=1200000 OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45Figure24Hdiff.lean`
logged to `/tmp/osr_hdiff_aext_endpoint_gap_1779267976.log` exits `1`.
The ordinary unsolved goal is the displayed A1ext/A0ext moving-current
comparison; downstream deterministic timeout diagnostics remain while this
ordinary local leaf is open.  No `sorry`, `admit`, or `axiom` occurs in Hdiff.

## Previous Delta

Lean now checks the endpoint-limit side of the remaining ordinary path-chart
comparison explicitly.  With the common moving support collar in context, the
source path chart has only its zero-height endpoint limit:

```lean
have hSourcePathMoving_endpoint :
    Tendsto SourcePathMoving (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0))
      (nhds
        (∫ u, (OrdPathChart cm.1).branch (OrdSourceApproach 0 u) *
          (piece : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u))
```

The Wick path chart has the selected Schwinger limit:

```lean
have hWickPathMoving_selected :
    Tendsto WickPathMoving (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0))
      (nhds (OS.S n pieceZD))
```

Therefore Lean also checks the honest endpoint-gap limit:

```lean
have hpath_moving_endpoint_gap :
    Tendsto (fun eps => SourcePathMoving eps - WickPathMoving eps)
      (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0))
      (nhds
        ((∫ u, (OrdPathChart cm.1).branch (OrdSourceApproach 0 u) *
          (piece : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u) - OS.S n pieceZD))
```

This packet deliberately does not close the selector by asserting the endpoint
gap is zero.  It shows in Lean that the remaining `nhds 0` path-comparison is
exactly the missing OS-I/current transport through the Figure-2-4 corridor.

Fresh exact check:
`lake env lean -DmaxHeartbeats=1200000 OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45Figure24Hdiff.lean`
logged to `/tmp/osr_hdiff_path_endpoint_gap_1779266994.log` exits `1`.
The ordinary unsolved goal is still the displayed
`SourcePathMoving - WickPathMoving` comparison; downstream deterministic
timeout diagnostics remain while this ordinary local leaf is open.

## Earlier Delta

The ordinary localized comparison has been sharpened again.  After the checked
fixed-test/moving-test source packet, terminal `extendF` normalization, and
flat side-height/Jacobian pullback, the flat side-height selector is now carried
through the distributional boundary-value theorem to the zero-height local
functional `Tlocal pieceFlat`.

```lean
have hflat_to_Tlocal :
    Tendsto FlatMovingSide (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0))
      (nhds (Tlocal pieceFlat))
```

This uses the real support packet `hpieceFlat_E` plus
`os45_BHWJost_flatCommonChart_distributionalBoundaryValue_plus_of_zeroHeight_pairingCLM`;
it does not assert a terminal endpoint equality.  The source/Wick support
collar was also tightened: the compact `Kpiece` now lies in
`UOrdSourcePath cm ∩ UOrdWickPath cs ∩ Usrc`, so the moving side-zero support
can be retargeted on both endpoint charts.

The checked new local chart retargeting is:

```lean
let SourcePathMoving : Real -> Complex := ...
let WickPathMoving : Real -> Complex := ...

have hSourceExtend_to_path :
    SourceMovingExtendF =ᶠ[nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0)] SourcePathMoving

have hWickMoving_to_path :
    WickMovingSide =ᶠ[nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0)] WickPathMoving
```

The remaining ordinary leaf is now the genuinely local chart-to-chart moving
comparison with the same moving side-zero weight:

```lean
Tendsto (fun eps => SourcePathMoving eps - WickPathMoving eps)
  (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0)) (nhds 0)
```

A further endpoint packet is now checked in Lean:

```lean
have hpath_moving_endpoint_collar :
    forallᶠ eps in nhdsWithin (0 : Real) (Set.Ioi 0), forall u,
      u ∈ Function.support
        (((D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM 1 1 eps eta0 pieceFlat).1 :
          SchwartzNPoint d n) : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) ->
        OrdSourceApproach eps u ∈ (OrdPathChart cm.1).carrier /\
        OrdWickApproach 0 u ∈ (OrdPathChart cs.1).carrier /\
        u ∈ P.V
```

This is the intended transport gap with the endpoint charts and common moving
support/current collar explicit.  What remains is the actual OS-I/current
transport through the Figure-2-4 path corridor; a bare finite chart chain is
still not enough without the intermediate approach/weight packets or a real
local boundary-value comparison at each approach mismatch.

Fresh exact check:
`lake env lean -DmaxHeartbeats=1200000 OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45Figure24Hdiff.lean`
logged to `/tmp/osr_hdiff_endpoint_collar_1779265760.log` exits `1`.
The ordinary unsolved goal is still the displayed
`SourcePathMoving - WickPathMoving` comparison, now with
`hpath_moving_endpoint_collar` in context.  Downstream deterministic timeout
diagnostics are still present while this ordinary local leaf is open.

## Exact Live Goals

Inside the current `hzero_minus` body, after fixing `eta0`, `D`, `psi0`, and
the source compact packet, the two remaining goals are:

```lean
let l : Filter Real := nhdsWithin (0 : Real) (Set.Ioi 0)

have hOrd_side_current :
    Tendsto
      (fun eps : Real =>
        ∫ u : NPointDomain d n,
          BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
            (BHW.os45FlatCommonChartSourceSide d n
              (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (1 : Real) eps eta0 u) *
          ((((D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM
            (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (1 : Real) eps eta0 phi).1 :
              SchwartzNPoint d n) : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u))
      l
      (nhds (OS.S n (D.toZeroDiagonalCLM
        (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) phi))) := by
  -- direct ordinary `(4.1)/(4.14)` source-current selector

let tauOut : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) :=
  (P.τ.symm * (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))).symm

have hAdj_side_current :
    Tendsto
      (fun eps : Real =>
        ∫ u : NPointDomain d n,
          BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
            (BHW.permAct (d := d) tauOut
              (BHW.os45FlatCommonChartSourceSide d n
                (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (-1 : Real) eps eta0 u)) *
          ((((D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM
            (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (-1 : Real) eps eta0 phi).1 :
              SchwartzNPoint d n) : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u))
      l
      (nhds (OS.S n (D.toZeroDiagonalCLM
        (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) phi))) := by
  -- direct retained raw `(4.12)/(4.14)` source-current selector
```

The endpoint DCTs already present in the body are the final moving-test
upgrade, not the chart-transport proof.  The missing work is first to select
the fixed flat translated-boundary value by the ordinary `(4.1)` and retained
raw `(4.12)` one-branch chains.  Fixed endpoint DCT then identifies the
zero-height endpoint with that selected value, and only then do the moving
endpoint DCTs close the displayed side-current families.

## Current Lean Delta

As of the current Hdiff frontier, the misleading endpoint-value shortcuts have
been removed from the two live selector bodies.  The remaining Lean goals are
now the fixed source-current transport statements themselves:

```lean
have hOrdPieceFixed_selected :
    Tendsto OrdPieceFixed l (nhds (OS.S n (psiOrdPieceZD a))) := by
  -- ordinary `(4.1)/(4.14)` fixed source-current transport

have hAdjPieceFixed_selected :
    Tendsto AdjPieceFixed l (nhds (OS.S n (psiAdjPieceZD a))) := by
  -- retained raw `(4.12)/(4.14)` fixed source-current transport
```

Do not reintroduce a proof obligation of the form
`terminal endpoint integral = OS.S ...`.  The checked endpoint DCTs only say
that the fixed source-current family tends to its zero-height endpoint.  The
missing OS-I step is stronger and earlier: it must identify the fixed
positive-side source current with the Schwinger value before endpoint
continuity is used.

Latest ordinary-side packet progress:

```lean
let OrdWickApproach :
    Real -> NPointDomain d n -> Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> Complex :=
  fun _eps u => fun k => wickRotatePoint (u k)

let OrdWickWeight : Real -> NPointDomain d n -> Complex :=
  fun _eps u => (psiOrdPieceSource a : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u

let OrdSourceApproach :
    Real -> NPointDomain d n -> Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> Complex :=
  fun eps u =>
    BHW.os45FlatCommonChartSourceSide d n
      (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (1 : Real) eps eta0 u

let OrdSourceWeight : Real -> NPointDomain d n -> Complex :=
  fun _eps u => (psiOrdPieceSource a : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u
```

The incoming ordinary Wick edge now has the same support-aware packet shape as
the terminal edge.  A local chart `A0ext` has the same carrier as `A0a` and
branch `BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)`, and Lean checks:

```lean
have hOrd_A0ext_A0_collar :
    forallᶠ eps in l, forall u,
      u ∈ Function.support (OrdWickWeight eps) ->
        OrdWickApproach eps u ∈ A0ext.carrier ∩ A0a.carrier

have hOrd_A0ext_to_A0_integral :
    (fun eps =>
      ∫ u, A0ext.branch (OrdWickApproach eps u) *
        OrdWickWeight eps u)
      =ᶠ[l]
    fun eps =>
      ∫ u, A0a.branch (OrdWickApproach eps u) *
        OrdWickWeight eps u

have hOrd_A0ext_wick_value :
    (∫ u, A0ext.branch (OrdWickApproach 0 u) *
      OrdWickWeight 0 u) =
    OS.S n (psiOrdPieceZD a)
```

The ordinary terminal retarget is now Lean-checked without using an endpoint
Schwinger shortcut.  A local chart `A1ext` has the same carrier as `A1a` and
branch `BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)`.  The proof now has:

```lean
have hOrd_A1ext_A1_collar :
    forallᶠ eps in l, forall u,
      u ∈ Function.support (OrdSourceWeight eps) ->
        OrdSourceApproach eps u ∈ A1ext.carrier ∩ A1a.carrier

have hOrd_A1ext_to_A1_integral :
    (fun eps =>
      ∫ u, A1ext.branch (OrdSourceApproach eps u) *
        OrdSourceWeight eps u)
      =ᶠ[l]
    fun eps =>
      ∫ u, A1a.branch (OrdSourceApproach eps u) *
        OrdSourceWeight eps u

have hOrd_A1ext_endpoint_bvt :
    (∫ u, A1ext.branch (OrdSourceApproach 0 u) *
      OrdSourceWeight 0 u) =
    ∫ u, bvt_F OS lgc n (OrdSourceApproach 0 u) *
      OrdSourceWeight 0 u

have hOrd_A1ext_endpoint_flat_zero :
    (∫ x,
      BHW.os45FlatCommonChartBranch d n OS lgc
        (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (fun j => (x j : Complex)) *
      psiOrdPieceFlat a x) =
    J * ∫ u, A1ext.branch (OrdSourceApproach 0 u) *
      OrdSourceWeight 0 u

have hOrd_A1ext_endpoint_Tlocal :
    J * ∫ u, A1ext.branch (OrdSourceApproach 0 u) *
      OrdSourceWeight 0 u =
    Tlocal (psiOrdPieceFlat a)

have hOrdPieceFixed_scaled_Tlocal :
    Tendsto (fun eps => J * OrdPieceFixed eps) l
      (nhds (Tlocal (psiOrdPieceFlat a)))

have hFlatOrd_piece_selected_Tlocal :
    Tendsto (FlatOrdPiece a) l
      (nhds (Tlocal (psiOrdPieceFlat a)))
```

The old center-only terminal-left collar is intentionally not the next target:
it does not control the support of the source-current integral.  The remaining
ordinary gap is now sharper: the localized fixed ordinary piece has been
selected to the ordinary edge CLM, so the missing normalization is the genuine
piece-level equality

```lean
Tlocal (psiOrdPieceFlat a) = J * OS.S n (psiOrdPieceZD a)
```

This equality still has to come from the real OS-I/Wick-anchor transport, not
from the zero-height endpoint DCT alone.  If the route proceeds by the finite
chart chain, the relevant positive-side approaches and weights still need
support-aware edge packets.

Current ordinary-side source-cover progress:

```lean
have hOrd_source_path_cover_inter_zero_support :
    ∀ u ∈ tsupport (ψOrdPieceSource a : NPointDomain d n -> Complex),
      ∃ c : KOrdPath,
        c ∈ sOrdPath ∧
          OrdSourceApproach 0 u ∈
            (OrdPathChart c).carrier ∩ A1ext.carrier

let αOrdSourcePath := sOrdPath
let UOrdSourcePath : αOrdSourcePath -> Set (NPointDomain d n) := fun c =>
  {u | OrdSourceApproach 0 u ∈
    (OrdPathChart c.1).carrier ∩ A1ext.carrier}

have hOrd_source_path_cover_zero_tsupport :
    tsupport (ψOrdPieceSource a : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) ⊆
      ⋃ c : αOrdSourcePath, UOrdSourcePath c

have hOrdPathChart_model :
    ∀ z : KOrdPath,
      Set.EqOn (OrdPathChart z).branch
        (BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n))
        (OrdPathChart z).carrier

have hOrd_source_zero_support_branch_witness :
    ∀ u,
      u ∈ Function.support (OrdSourceWeight 0) ->
        ∃ c : αOrdSourcePath,
          u ∈ UOrdSourcePath c ∧
            A1ext.branch (OrdSourceApproach 0 u) =
              (OrdPathChart c.1).branch (OrdSourceApproach 0 u)

have hOrd_source_path_piece_collar :
    ∀ c : αOrdSourcePath,
      ∀ w : SchwartzNPoint d n,
        HasCompactSupport (w : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) ->
        tsupport (w : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) ⊆ UOrdSourcePath c ->
        ∀ᶠ eps in l, ∀ u,
          u ∈ Function.support (w : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) ->
            OrdSourceApproach eps u ∈
              (OrdPathChart c.1).carrier ∩ A1ext.carrier

have hOrd_A1ext_to_pathChart_piece_integral :
    ∀ c : αOrdSourcePath,
      ∀ w : SchwartzNPoint d n,
        HasCompactSupport (w : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) ->
        tsupport (w : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) ⊆ UOrdSourcePath c ->
        (fun eps =>
          ∫ u, A1ext.branch (OrdSourceApproach eps u) * w u)
          =ᶠ[l]
        fun eps =>
          ∫ u, (OrdPathChart c.1).branch
            (OrdSourceApproach eps u) * w u
```

This is the honest compact-local split point for the ordinary selector: the
source support is now covered by finite chart preimages at zero height, with
the terminal `A1ext` carrier included.  The latest checked increment also
names the common-model fact for every finite path chart and turns the cover
into an actual support-level branch witness: on every zero-height source
support point, `A1ext.branch` agrees with the witnessed path-chart branch at
the same approach.  It also now has the fixed-chart positive-side collar:
any future localized source test supported in a chosen `UOrdSourcePath c`
has its moving positive-side approach eventually inside the same
`OrdPathChart c/A1ext` overlap.  Finally, this collar is consumed in the first
scalar edge-integral transport: for such a localized source test, the
`A1ext` integral and the selected path-chart integral are eventually equal
with the same approach and weight.

A full source-piece Schwartz partition subordinate to these preimages was
tested in the live theorem body.  Even when compressed into a single
existential packet, carrying the partition construction through the giant
proof context caused deterministic downstream elaboration timeouts.  The next
implementation should either consume such a partition in a helper whose
exported result is a scalar edge-integral equality, or build the first
positive-side edge packet directly from the support-level witness and
fixed-chart collar above.  The latter now exists for the `A1ext -> OrdPathChart`
retarget; the next missing part is producing/consuming the localized source
pieces without carrying the raw partition construction through the whole
theorem body.

Latest Lean delta: the neutral helper
`exists_finite_schwartz_smul_partition_on_tsupport` now packages the finite
Schwartz source partition produced by a finite open cover of a compact
topological support.  Re-consuming that helper directly inside
`hOrdPieceFixed_selected` again typechecked locally but reintroduced
downstream elaboration timeouts, so the in-body use was backed out.  The
helper should next be consumed by a slimmer scalar-transport helper whose
result does not keep the raw partition witnesses in the producer context.

Latest incremental helper: `sourceSide_integral_eventually_eq_sum_chart_partition`
now performs that scalar transport outside the giant producer context.  It
packages a finite Schwartz partition subordinate to source-side carrier
preimages, proves eventual integrability for both chart branches, splits the
original source integral into the finite localized sum, and uses the supplied
overlap `EqOn` plus the moving support collar to transport the sum to the
neighboring chart branches.  A direct one-line consumption of this helper
inside `hOrdPieceFixed_selected` was also tested; the theorem itself checks,
but even the compact existential packet still causes downstream elaboration
timeouts when kept in the open producer context.  Do not keep that local
packet until the ordinary selector proof is reorganized so the packet is
consumed immediately inside a completed subproof.

The final common-edge endpoint algebra is now discharged by the small local
folding lemma
`commonEdge_pulledRealBranch_sub_eq_zero_of_extendF_perm_eq`; this removes the
previous strict-heartbeat timeout at the terminal `rw`/`change` without
changing the mathematical selector frontier.

Fresh exact check:

```bash
lake env lean -DmaxHeartbeats=1200000 OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45Figure24Hdiff.lean
```

Log: `/tmp/osr_hdiff_endpoint_helper_1779252829.log`.

Result: exit code `1`, with only the two intended selector unsolved goals at
`Hdiff.lean:5106:64` and `Hdiff.lean:7978:58`; no timeout diagnostics.

Fresh exact check after the top-level scalar transport helper:

```bash
lake env lean -DmaxHeartbeats=1200000 OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45Figure24Hdiff.lean
```

Log: `/tmp/osr_hdiff_toplevel_only_1779254354.log`.

Result: exit code `1`, with only the two intended selector unsolved goals at
`Hdiff.lean:5308:64` (`hOrdPieceFixed_selected`) and `Hdiff.lean:8180:58`
(`hAdjPieceFixed_selected`); no timeout diagnostics.

For the finite chain, branch equality on overlaps is useful only when the two
neighboring chart integrals have first been put into the same local
side-height coordinates on a support collar.  A bare chain of pointed charts
and seeds does not by itself compare different approach families.  Each step
must therefore provide:

```lean
have hleft_to_edge :
    I_left =ᶠ[l]
      fun eps => ∫ x, A.branch (edgeApproach eps x) * edgeWeight eps x

have hright_to_edge :
    I_right =ᶠ[l]
      fun eps => ∫ x, B.branch (edgeApproach eps x) * edgeWeight eps x

have hedge_collar :
    ∀ᶠ eps in l, ∀ x,
      x ∈ Function.support (edgeWeight eps : X -> Complex) ->
        edgeApproach eps x ∈ A.carrier ∩ B.carrier
```

Only after these three facts are in place may
`PointedMetricBranchChart.eqOn_inter_of_seed` turn the overlap seed into
equality of the two edge integrals.  If two adjacent slots naturally use
different local approaches, insert the local boundary-value/DCT comparison
there; do not hide the mismatch behind `eventual_eq`.

## Fixed Local Objects

Use exactly these local definitions.  Do not replace the raw adjacent seed by a
downstream deterministic branch.

```lean
let e := BHW.os45CommonEdgeFlatCLE d n (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))

let psi0 : SchwartzNPoint d n :=
  (D.toZeroDiagonalCLM (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) phi).1

-- `psi0Flat` and the common-edge Jacobian are active in the fixed selector.
-- They belong to the flat translated-boundary selection and scalar
-- cancellation layer, before the moving endpoint DCTs are used.

let sourceSide (sgn eps : Real)
    (eta : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n) (u : NPointDomain d n) :=
  BHW.os45FlatCommonChartSourceSide
    d n (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) sgn eps eta u

let sigmaOrd : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) := 1
let sigmaAdj : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) :=
  P.τ.symm * (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))

have hSigmaAdj_symm : sigmaAdj.symm = P.τ := by
  simp [sigmaAdj]

let gammaOrd : unitInterval -> Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> Complex :=
  BHW.os45Figure24IdentityPath (d := d) (n := n) x

let gammaAdjSeed : unitInterval -> Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> Complex :=
  fun t => BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ (gammaOrd t)

let OmegaSeed412 : Set (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> Complex) :=
  {z | BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ z ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n} ∩ H.ΩJ

let BSeed412 : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> Complex) -> Complex :=
  fun z => bvt_F OS lgc n (BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ z)
```

The raw current path starts at `gammaAdjSeed 0`.  The statement
`gammaOrd 0 ∈ OmegaSeed412` is false in the current Lean facts and must not be
used.

The first four private boundary-value leaves are only raw tube-ray inputs.
They do not by themselves prove either displayed source-current goal.  They
become useful only after the local chain has related the incoming ray to the
terminal flat/source-side family.  Likewise,
`D.sideZeroDiagonal_sourcePairings_tendstoUniformlyOn_schwinger` is a checked
source-current normalization/support package; it must not be treated as the
finite chart-transport selector.

## Checked Carrier Facts To Use

The selector must be written against the carrier facts that are actually
checked in `OSToWightmanLocalityOS45Figure24Hdiff.lean`; do not invent a
generic chain packet.

Ordinary-sector charts have the `OrdModelAtZ0` shape:

```lean
OrdModelAtZ0 d n z0 (BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)) A
```

They are produced by the checked pointed adapters
`H.ordinaryWick_pointedChartInWindow` and
`H.ordinaryCommonEdge_pointedChartInWindow`.  Their load-bearing fields are

```lean
A.carrier ⊆ (BHW.ExtendedTube d n ∩ H.ΩJ) ∩ W
Set.EqOn A.branch (BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)) A.carrier
```

An ordinary edge is therefore local and direct:

```lean
have hedge :
    PointedSeedEdge z0 A.carrier B.carrier A.branch B.branch :=
  pointed_seed_edge_of_common_model
    A.carrier_open B.carrier_open hA.z0_mem hB.z0_mem
    hA.eq_ord hB.eq_ord
```

Raw-adjacent-sector charts use retained `(4.12)` provenance, not the endpoint
deterministic branch.  The incoming chart is produced by
`H.OS412SeedWindow_pointedChart` at
`zadj = gammaAdjSeed 0`, with

```lean
A.carrier ⊆
  (({z | BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ z ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n} ∩ H.ΩJ) ∩
    (BHW.ExtendedTube d n ∩
      BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n P.τ))
Set.EqOn A.branch BSeed412 A.carrier
```

Interior raw edges should be represented as `RawRetargetAtZ0` data against a
single local raw chart:

```lean
RawRetargetAtZ0 d n z0 A rawLocal
```

and the actual edge consumed by the selector is

```lean
hA_adj.edge_to_raw :
  PointedSeedEdge z0 A.carrier rawLocal.carrier A.branch rawLocal.branch
```

If two raw charts both retarget to the same `rawLocal`, use
`os45_pointed_gallery_pair_one_one` or the equivalent inline one-step gallery;
do not call `LocalOverlapAtZ0.flat_plus_minus`,
`LocalOverlapAtZ0.flat_minus_plus`, or
`localOverlapAtZ0_galleryPair` in the source-current selector.  Those flat
constructors call
`flat_realJost_EOW_pointed_seed_of_localZeroHeight_pairingsCLM`, whose inputs
include the zero-height pairings being proved.

The terminal raw-to-flat-minus rewrite is not an incoming chart.  It is a
support-local final step after the retained raw chain has reached the terminal
flat-minus expression and after the eventual sheet membership has proved

```lean
BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ
  (sourceSide (-1 : Real) eps eta0 u) ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n
```

on the compact support.  Only there may
`BHW.extendF_eq_on_forwardTube` rewrite the terminal expression to the
displayed `extendF ∘ permAct` form consumed by the source-side DCT.

Every selector edge then has the same identity-theorem use:

```lean
have hEq_inter :
    Set.EqOn A.branch B.branch (A.carrier ∩ B.carrier) :=
  PointedMetricBranchChart.eqOn_inter_of_seed A B
    ⟨edge.W, edge.W_open, edge.z0_mem, edge.W_sub, edge.eqOn⟩
```

The edge proof is incomplete unless this promoted carrier-intersection
equality is the equality used inside `integral_congr_ae`.

## Source Support Packet

The fixed selector and the later moving endpoint DCT must use compatible
source support.  The fixed selector works with the compact flat test
`psi0Flat` and its translated supports.  The moving endpoint DCT works with the
live signed `D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM` tests.  Both are tied to the same source
window packet in the current `Hdiff` body:

```lean
let Ssrc : Set (NPointDomain d n) :=
  e.symm '' tsupport (phi : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n -> Complex)

obtain ⟨Ksrc, hKsrc_compact, hSsrc_int, hKsrcU⟩ :=
  exists_compact_between hSsrc_compact hU_open hSsrcU

let Usrc : Set (NPointDomain d n) := interior Ksrc

have hphiUsrc :
    tsupport (phi : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n -> Complex) ⊆
      e '' Usrc := by
  -- already present as `hφUsrc` in the current file
```

Before using the moving endpoint DCT, add the signed side-test support
eventuality and specialize it to the chosen `eta0`:

```lean
have hcurrent_tsupport_Usrc :
    ∀ᶠ eps in l, ∀ eta ∈ Keta,
      tsupport ((D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM
        (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (1 : Real) eps eta phi).1 :
          NPointDomain d n -> Complex) ⊆ Usrc ∧
      tsupport ((D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM
        (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (-1 : Real) eps eta phi).1 :
          NPointDomain d n -> Complex) ⊆ Usrc := by
  simpa [l] using
    D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM_tsupport_subset_image_eventually
      hUsrc_open Keta hKeta phi hphi_compact hphiUsrc

have hcurrent_support_Ksrc_ord :
    ∀ᶠ eps in l,
      Function.support
        (((D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM
          (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (1 : Real) eps eta0 phi).1 :
            SchwartzNPoint d n) : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) ⊆
        Ksrc := by
  filter_upwards [hcurrent_tsupport_Usrc] with eps heps u hu
  exact hUsrc_sub_Ksrc ((heps eta0 hEta0).1 (subset_tsupport _ hu))

have hcurrent_support_Ksrc_adj :
    ∀ᶠ eps in l,
      Function.support
        (((D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM
          (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (-1 : Real) eps eta0 phi).1 :
            SchwartzNPoint d n) : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) ⊆
        Ksrc := by
  filter_upwards [hcurrent_tsupport_Usrc] with eps heps u hu
  exact hUsrc_sub_Ksrc ((heps eta0 hEta0).2 (subset_tsupport _ hu))
```

This support object is for the endpoint/moving-test layer.  The edge
`integral_congr_ae` steps inside `hflatOrd_selected` and `hflatAdj_selected`
use the compact support of `psi0Flat` and the translated-test collar described
in the finite selector section below.  If the implementation instead proves
local fixed selectors on a finite source cover, then split the test first and
prove both the fixed `psi0Flat` collar and the moving endpoint support packet
for each localized piece; do not run a chart chain centered at a single source
point against an unlocalized compact integral.

## Active Proof Shape

Correction, 2026-05-18: do **not** prove the two moving-current holes by a
finite induction that transports the checked Wick current pairings directly
from the Wick endpoint to the terminal `sourceSide` endpoint.  That would
mistake analytic continuation for equality of branch values at different
points.  The finite chart induction belongs one level earlier: it selects the
fixed flat translated-boundary limit.  The live moving-current holes then close
by the already checked endpoint DCTs.

The direct in-body proof has three layers:

1. Fixed source-side selector:
   prove `Tendsto OrdFixed l (nhds Lcur)` and
   `Tendsto AdjFixed l (nhds Lcur)` by the one-branch flat translated-boundary
   selector, scalar cancellation, and endpoint normalization.
2. Fixed endpoint DCT:
   prove `Tendsto OrdFixed l (nhds OrdEndpoint)` and
   `Tendsto AdjFixed l (nhds AdjEndpoint)` with the checked source-side DCT
   for the fixed test `psi0`.
3. Moving endpoint DCT:
   use the already-present `hOrd_endpoint_DCT` and `hAdj_endpoint_DCT` for the
   moving `D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM` tests, rewriting their endpoint values by
   uniqueness of limits from steps 1 and 2.

The theorem
`D.sideZeroDiagonal_sourcePairings_tendstoUniformlyOn_schwinger` remains a
checked Wick-current normalization package, but it is not the active
chart-transport selector for these two holes.

## Fixed Outer Skeleton

Inside each live hole, use only local `have`s.  The common definitions are:

```lean
let Lcur : Complex :=
  OS.S n (D.toZeroDiagonalCLM (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) phi)

let sourceSide (sgn eps : Real)
    (eta : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n) (u : NPointDomain d n) :=
  BHW.os45FlatCommonChartSourceSide
    d n (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) sgn eps eta u

let e := BHW.os45CommonEdgeFlatCLE d n (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))

let psi0 : SchwartzNPoint d n :=
  (D.toZeroDiagonalCLM (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) phi).1

let psi0Flat : SchwartzMap (BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n) Complex :=
  (SchwartzMap.compCLMOfContinuousLinearEquiv Complex e.symm)
    ((psi0 : SchwartzNPoint d n))

let pullFlatToSource :
    SchwartzMap (BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n) Complex →L[Complex]
      SchwartzNPoint d n :=
  SchwartzMap.compCLMOfContinuousLinearEquiv Complex e

have hpull_psi0Flat : pullFlatToSource psi0Flat = psi0 := by
  simp [pullFlatToSource, psi0Flat, e]

obtain ⟨hpsi0Flat_compact, hpsi0Flat_edge⟩ :
    HasCompactSupport
        (psi0Flat : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n -> Complex) ∧
      tsupport
        (psi0Flat : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n -> Complex) ⊆
        BHW.os45FlatCommonChartEdgeSet d n P
          (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) := by
  simpa [psi0, psi0Flat, e] using
    D.toZeroDiagonalCLM_flatPullback_support
      (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) phi hφUsrc hKsrcU
```

The support input to `toZeroDiagonalCLM_flatPullback_support` is the source
window version `hφUsrc`, not merely `hφE`; this keeps the fixed selector and
the later moving endpoint DCT on the same compact current carrier.

### Ordinary Skeleton

```lean
let OrdFixed : Real -> Complex := fun eps =>
  ∫ u : NPointDomain d n,
    BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
      (sourceSide (1 : Real) eps eta0 u) *
    (psi0 : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u

let OrdEndpoint : Complex :=
  ∫ u : NPointDomain d n,
    BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
      (sourceSide (1 : Real) 0 eta0 u) *
    (psi0 : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u

have hOrd_fixed_selected :
    Tendsto OrdFixed l (nhds Lcur) := by
  -- section `Ordinary Fixed Selector` below

have hOrd_fixed_endpoint :
    Tendsto OrdFixed l (nhds OrdEndpoint) := by
  -- fixed-test endpoint DCT only.
  -- Use
  -- `BHW.tendsto_integral_comp_os45FlatCommonChartSourceSide_mul_of_hasCompactSupport`
  -- or the assembled fixed special case of

  -- with constant `phi0 = psi0`.

have hOrd_endpoint_value : OrdEndpoint = Lcur :=
  tendsto_nhds_unique hOrd_fixed_endpoint hOrd_fixed_selected

have hOrd_side_current :
    Tendsto
      (fun eps : Real =>
        ∫ u : NPointDomain d n,
          BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
            (sourceSide (1 : Real) eps eta0 u) *
          ((((D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM
            (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (1 : Real) eps eta0 phi).1 :
              SchwartzNPoint d n) : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u))
      l (nhds Lcur) := by
  -- `hOrd_endpoint_DCT` is already present in the live Hdiff context.
  simpa [OrdEndpoint, sourceSide, hOrd_endpoint_value] using hOrd_endpoint_DCT
```

### Raw-Adjacent Skeleton

```lean
let tauOut : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) :=
  (P.τ.symm * (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))).symm

let sigmaAdj : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) :=
  P.τ.symm * (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))

have hSigmaAdj_symm : sigmaAdj.symm = P.τ := by
  simp [sigmaAdj]

let AdjFixed : Real -> Complex := fun eps =>
  ∫ u : NPointDomain d n,
    BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
      (BHW.permAct (d := d) tauOut
        (sourceSide (-1 : Real) eps eta0 u)) *
    (psi0 : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u

let AdjEndpoint : Complex :=
  ∫ u : NPointDomain d n,
    BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
      (BHW.permAct (d := d) tauOut
        (sourceSide (-1 : Real) 0 eta0 u)) *
    (psi0 : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u

have hAdj_fixed_selected :
    Tendsto AdjFixed l (nhds Lcur) := by
  -- section `Raw-Adjacent Fixed Selector` below

have hAdj_fixed_endpoint :
    Tendsto AdjFixed l (nhds AdjEndpoint) := by
  -- fixed-test endpoint DCT with carrier
  -- `{z | BHW.permAct (d := d) tauOut z ∈ BHW.ExtendedTube d n}`.

have hAdj_endpoint_value : AdjEndpoint = Lcur :=
  tendsto_nhds_unique hAdj_fixed_endpoint hAdj_fixed_selected

have hAdj_side_current :
    Tendsto
      (fun eps : Real =>
        ∫ u : NPointDomain d n,
          BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
            (BHW.permAct (d := d) tauOut
              (sourceSide (-1 : Real) eps eta0 u)) *
          ((((D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM
            (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (-1 : Real) eps eta0 phi).1 :
              SchwartzNPoint d n) : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u))
      l (nhds Lcur) := by
  simpa [AdjEndpoint, sourceSide, tauOut, hAdj_endpoint_value] using
    hAdj_endpoint_DCT
```

The adjacent fixed selector starts from the retained raw `(4.12)` seed
`OmegaSeed412/BSeed412`; the displayed `extendF ∘ permAct` expression is only
the terminal normal form used after the raw chain reaches the outgoing sheet.

## Ordinary Fixed Selector

The hard ordinary selector proves `hOrd_fixed_selected`.  It should be expanded
inside the `hOrd_side_current` block:

```lean
let J : Complex := BHW.os45CommonEdgeFlatJacobianAbs n

let psiFlatOrd (eps : Real) :
    SchwartzMap (BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n) Complex :=
  SCV.translateSchwartz (-(eps • eta0)) psi0Flat

let FlatOrd : Real -> Complex := fun eps =>
  ∫ x : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n,
    BHW.os45FlatCommonChartBranch d n OS lgc
      (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
      (fun a => (x a : Complex) + ((eps • eta0) a : Complex) * Complex.I) *
    psiFlatOrd eps x

have hflatOrd_selected :
    Tendsto FlatOrd l (nhds (J * Lcur)) := by
  -- finite flat-boundary selector:
  -- 1. build the ordinary one-branch chain from the `(4.1)` incoming chart;
  -- 2. base limit is the genuine ordinary OS-I boundary-value theorem, not
  --    the terminal `sourceSide` family;
  -- 3. promote every stored seed by
  --    `PointedMetricBranchChart.eqOn_inter_of_seed`;
  -- 4. use compact collars for the chart-local flat approach family;
  -- 5. terminal rewrite uses the ordinary flat plus branch above.

have hOrd_fixed_selected :
    Tendsto OrdFixed l (nhds Lcur) := by
  have hinteg :
      ∀ᶠ eps in l,
        Integrable
          (fun x : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n =>
            BHW.os45FlatCommonChartBranch d n OS lgc
              (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
              (fun j =>
                (x j : Complex) + (((1 : Real) * eps) • eta0 j : Complex) *
                  Complex.I) *
            (SCV.translateSchwartz (-((1 : Real) * eps) • eta0) psi0Flat)
              (x + ((1 : Real) * eps) • eta0)) := by
    -- from `BHW.os45FlatCommonChart_branch_side_shifted_mul_integrable_eventually`
    -- specialized to `psi0Flat`, `hpsi0Flat_compact`, `hpsi0Flat_edge`.
  have hcancel :=
    BHW.tendsto_integral_comp_os45FlatCommonChartSourceSide_fixed_of_flatTranslatedTest
      (d := d) (n := n) OS lgc
      (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
      (1 : Real) eta0 psi0Flat
      hinteg hflatOrd_selected
  -- Rewrite the fixed source test by `hpull_psi0Flat`.
  simpa [OrdFixed, sourceSide, psi0Flat, pullFlatToSource,
    SchwartzMap.compCLMOfContinuousLinearEquiv_apply, one_mul] using hcancel
```

The base normalization inside `hflatOrd_selected` eventually reduces to
`bvt_euclidean_restriction` for `D.toZeroDiagonalCLM 1 phi`, after the ordinary
chain trace has identified the selected fixed boundary functional with the
Wick pairing.

## Raw-Adjacent Fixed Selector

The raw-adjacent selector has the same scalar-cancellation shell but a different
incoming analytic element:

```lean
let OmegaSeed412 : Set (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> Complex) :=
  {z | BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ z ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n} ∩ H.ΩJ

let BSeed412 : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> Complex) -> Complex :=
  fun z => bvt_F OS lgc n (BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ z)

let psiFlatAdj (eps : Real) :
    SchwartzMap (BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n) Complex :=
  SCV.translateSchwartz (-((-eps) • eta0)) psi0Flat

let FlatAdj : Real -> Complex := fun eps =>
  ∫ x : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n,
    BHW.os45FlatCommonChartBranch d n OS lgc sigmaAdj
      (fun a => (x a : Complex) + (((-1 : Real) * eps) • eta0 a : Complex) *
        Complex.I) *
    psiFlatAdj eps x

have hflatAdj_selected :
    Tendsto FlatAdj l (nhds (J * Lcur)) := by
  -- finite flat-boundary selector:
  -- 1. base chart is `H.OS412SeedWindow_pointedChart` at
  --    `gammaAdjSeed 0`, model `BSeed412`;
  -- 2. interior edges preserve retained raw `(4.12)` provenance;
  -- 3. do not use the downstream flat plus/minus EOW seed;
  -- 4. terminal raw-to-flat-minus rewrite is support-local and happens only
  --    after the raw terminal chart is reached;
  -- 5. normalize the raw Wick trace with
  --    `BHW.os45CommonEdge_adjacentWick_sourcePairing_eq_schwinger`.

have hAdj_fixed_selected :
    Tendsto AdjFixed l (nhds Lcur) := by
  have hinteg :
      ∀ᶠ eps in l,
        Integrable
          (fun x : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n =>
            BHW.os45FlatCommonChartBranch d n OS lgc sigmaAdj
              (fun j =>
                (x j : Complex) + (((-1 : Real) * eps) • eta0 j : Complex) *
                  Complex.I) *
            (SCV.translateSchwartz (-((-1 : Real) * eps) • eta0) psi0Flat)
              (x + ((-1 : Real) * eps) • eta0)) := by
    -- same checked integrability theorem, minus side.
  have hcancel :=
    BHW.tendsto_integral_comp_os45FlatCommonChartSourceSide_fixed_of_flatTranslatedTest
      (d := d) (n := n) OS lgc
      sigmaAdj (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
      (-1 : Real) eta0 psi0Flat
      hinteg hflatAdj_selected
  simpa [AdjFixed, sourceSide, sigmaAdj, hSigmaAdj_symm, tauOut, psi0Flat,
    pullFlatToSource, SchwartzMap.compCLMOfContinuousLinearEquiv_apply,
    one_mul] using hcancel
```

The raw endpoint normalization is not `extendF_eq_on_forwardTube` at the
incoming seed.  The terminal support-local rewrite to
`extendF (bvt_F) (permAct P.τ z)` happens only after the retained raw chain has
reached the terminal flat-minus chart and the positive-height support is known
to be on the outgoing forward-tube sheet.

## Finite Flat-Boundary Selector

This is the only remaining hard mathematical body.  It is a finite induction
over flat translated-boundary integrals, not over the live moving source tests.
Do not introduce a chain wrapper for it.  Inside `hflatOrd_selected` and again
inside `hflatAdj_selected`, construct the following values as local `let`s and
`have`s, with the ordinary and raw-adjacent instantiations listed below.

```lean
let Z := Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> Complex
let X := BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n

-- One localized compact piece.  The finite partition construction below
-- supplies `psiF`, `psiZD`, and the equality of the finite sum with the
-- original `psi0Flat` / `D.toZeroDiagonalCLM 1 phi`.
let psiF : SchwartzMap X Complex := psiPieceFlat a
let psiZD : ZeroDiagonalSchwartz d n := psiPieceZD a
let psiS : SchwartzNPoint d n := psiZD.1
let Lpiece : Complex := OS.S n psiZD

have hpsiF_compact : HasCompactSupport (psiF : X -> Complex) := by
  -- `psiF` is `χ a * psi0Flat`; use compact support of `χ a`.

have hpsiF_Uloc :
    tsupport (psiF : X -> Complex) ⊆ Uloc a := by
  -- `tsupport (χ a) ⊆ Uloc a` and support of a product is contained in the
  -- support of the partition factor.

let len : Nat := chainLen
let chart : Fin (len + 1) -> PointedMetricBranchChart Z Complex :=
  chainChart
let edge :
    ∀ j : Fin len,
      PointedSeedEdge
        ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).center)
        ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).carrier)
        ((chart (Fin.succ j)).carrier)
        ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).branch)
        ((chart (Fin.succ j)).branch) :=
  chainEdge

let approach : Fin (len + 1) -> Real -> X -> Z := chainApproach
let weight : Fin (len + 1) -> Real -> SchwartzMap X Complex := chainWeight

let I (j : Fin (len + 1)) (eps : Real) : Complex :=
  ∫ x : X, (chart j).branch (approach j eps x) * (weight j eps x)
```

The displayed names `chainLen`, `chainChart`, `chainEdge`,
`chainApproach`, and `chainWeight` are not new constants.  They stand for the
local objects produced in the current proof block by the existing checked
ordinary or retained raw-adjacent chart constructors.  If Lean needs a helper,
the only acceptable split is a neutral finite-induction lemma for functions
`I : Fin (len + 1) -> Real -> Complex`; the branch corridors, base OS-I
normalizations, and terminal sheet rewrites must remain in the producer body.

### Compact Localization Layer

The local selector above is not run once on the whole compact support unless a
single corridor has already been proved to contain that whole support.  In the
current Hdiff producer, use finite localization.  This is the missing
compact-support step that makes the chart-local collars honest.

```lean
let K0 : Set X := tsupport (psi0Flat : X -> Complex)

have hK0_compact : IsCompact K0 := by
  simpa [K0] using hpsi0Flat_compact.isCompact

-- For every support point choose a local source point and two one-branch
-- corridors, one ordinary and one retained raw-adjacent.
have hlocal_cover_data :
    ∀ y : K0,
      ∃ V : Set X,
        IsOpen V ∧ y.1 ∈ V ∧
        (∃ c R, V ⊆ Metric.closedBall c R) ∧
        V ⊆ BHW.os45FlatCommonChartEdgeSet d n P
          (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) ∧
        e.symm '' V ⊆ Usrc := by
  intro y
  let u : NPointDomain d n := e.symm y.1
  have huU : u ∈ Usrc := by
    -- from the source-window support packet for `psi0Flat`.
  have huV : u ∈ P.V := hU_sub (hKsrcU (hUsrc_sub_Ksrc huU))
  -- Build the ordinary corridor along `gammaOrd u`.
  -- Build the retained raw corridor along
  -- `gammaAdjSeed u t = BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ (gammaOrd u t)`.

finite sum:

For each adjacent piece, the raw `(4.12)` base value is normalized to
`OS.S n (psiPieceZD a)` by `bvt_euclidean_restriction` plus
`OS.E3_symmetric`, not by the special current-test theorem for the unsplit
`D.toZeroDiagonalCLM` test.

### Per-Piece Corridor Construction

For each selected finite-cover index `a : α`, reconstruct the one-branch
corridor locally.  Do not store a public corridor object; use a proof-local
reachability predicate whose witnesses are exactly the values consumed by the
local selector.

```lean
let ya : K0 := a.1
let ua : NPointDomain d n := e.symm ya.1

have hua : ua ∈ Usrc := by
  -- from `hcover_K0`, `hpsiF_Uloc`, and the chosen local source window.

have huaV : ua ∈ P.V := hU_sub (hKsrcU (hUsrc_sub_Ksrc hua))

let gammaOrd_a : unitInterval -> Z :=
  BHW.os45Figure24IdentityPath (d := d) (n := n) ua

let gammaAdj_a : unitInterval -> Z :=
  fun t => BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ (gammaOrd_a t)
```

Ordinary reachability:

```lean
let ReachOrd : Set unitInterval := {t |
  ∃ len : Nat,
  ∃ chart : Fin (len + 1) -> PointedMetricBranchChart Z Complex,
  ∃ edge :
      ∀ j : Fin len,
        PointedSeedEdge
          ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).center)
          ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).carrier)
          ((chart (Fin.succ j)).carrier)
          ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).branch)
          ((chart (Fin.succ j)).branch),
    (chart 0).center = gammaOrd_a 0 ∧
    (chart (Fin.last len)).center = gammaOrd_a t ∧
    (∀ j, OrdModelAtZ0 d n ((chart j).center)
      (BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)) (chart j)) }

have hReachOrd0 : (0 : unitInterval) ∈ ReachOrd := by
  -- Use `H.ordinaryWick_pointedChartInWindow` at `ua`.

have hReachOrd_local :
    ∀ t : unitInterval, ∃ U : Set unitInterval, IsOpen U ∧ t ∈ U ∧
      ∀ ⦃s r : unitInterval⦄,
        s ∈ U -> r ∈ U -> s ∈ ReachOrd -> r ∈ ReachOrd := by
  intro t
  -- Build endpoint-centered ordinary charts by
  -- `H.ordinaryCommonEdge_pointedChartInWindow` or the ordinary Wick/window
  -- adapter appropriate to `gammaOrd_a t`.
  -- The successor edge is `pointed_seed_edge_of_common_model`, then
  -- the support collars are shrunk later using `hpsiF_Uloc`.

have hReachOrd_all : ReachOrd = Set.univ :=
  SCV.reachable_eq_univ_of_local_symmetric_extension
    ⟨0, hReachOrd0⟩ hReachOrd_local

obtain ⟨lenOrd, chartOrd, edgeOrd, hstartOrd, hendOrd, hmodelOrd⟩ :
    ∃ len : Nat,
    ∃ chart : Fin (len + 1) -> PointedMetricBranchChart Z Complex,
    ∃ edge :
      ∀ j : Fin len,
        PointedSeedEdge
          ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).center)
          ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).carrier)
          ((chart (Fin.succ j)).carrier)
          ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).branch)
          ((chart (Fin.succ j)).branch),
      (chart 0).center = gammaOrd_a 0 ∧
      (chart (Fin.last len)).center = gammaOrd_a 1 ∧
      (∀ j, OrdModelAtZ0 d n ((chart j).center)
        (BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)) (chart j)) := by
  have hterminal : (1 : unitInterval) ∈ ReachOrd := by
    simpa [hReachOrd_all]
  simpa [ReachOrd] using hterminal
```

Raw-adjacent reachability is the same shape with `gammaAdj_a`, but every chart
keeps retained raw `(4.12)` provenance.

```lean
let ReachAdj : Set unitInterval := {t |
  ∃ len : Nat,
  ∃ chart : Fin (len + 1) -> PointedMetricBranchChart Z Complex,
  ∃ edge :
      ∀ j : Fin len,
        PointedSeedEdge
          ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).center)
          ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).carrier)
          ((chart (Fin.succ j)).carrier)
          ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).branch)
          ((chart (Fin.succ j)).branch),
    (chart 0).center = gammaAdj_a 0 ∧
    (chart (Fin.last len)).center = gammaAdj_a 1 ∧
    (∀ j : Fin (len + 1),
      ∃ rawLocal : PointedMetricBranchChart Z Complex,
        RawRetargetAtZ0 d n ((chart j).center) (chart j) rawLocal) }
```

The raw local propagation input uses `H.OS412SeedWindow_pointedChart`,
`RawRetargetAtZ0.edge_to_raw`, and, when two raw restrictions must be compared,
`os45_pointed_gallery_pair_one_one`.  It does not use
`LocalOverlapAtZ0.flat_plus_minus`, `LocalOverlapAtZ0.flat_minus_plus`, or
`localOverlapAtZ0_galleryPair`.

The support contracts are deliberately not fields of `ReachOrd` or `ReachAdj`.
After the terminal chain is obtained, prove the edge and terminal collar
membership directly from `hpsiF_Uloc`, the open carrier balls, and continuity of
the concrete `approach` used in that edge.  If Lean requires a named helper
here, make it a neutral finite-reachability lemma over arbitrary charts and
edges; do not add an OS45 source-current wrapper.

The ordinary instantiation is:

```lean
-- chart 0: ordinary `(4.1)` incoming chart.
-- carrier is inside `(BHW.ExtendedTube d n ∩ H.ΩJ) ∩ W`.
-- branch is `BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)` on the carrier.
obtain ⟨A0, hA0_center, hA0_mem, hA0_sub, hA0_model, hA0_trace⟩ :=
  H.ordinaryWick_pointedChartInWindow OS lgc hbase_u_mem
    hbaseW_open hbaseW_mem

-- terminal chart: ordinary common-edge flat-plus chart.
-- branch is still `BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)` on the carrier.
obtain
    ⟨Aterm, hAterm_center, hAterm_mem, hAterm_sub,
      hAterm_model, hAterm_trace⟩ :=
  H.ordinaryCommonEdge_pointedChartInWindow hd OS lgc hterminal_u_mem
    hterminalW_open hterminalW_mem

have hordinary_edge :
    ∀ j : Fin len,
      PointedSeedEdge
        ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).center)
        ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).carrier)
        ((chart (Fin.succ j)).carrier)
        ((chart (Fin.castSucc j)).branch)
        ((chart (Fin.succ j)).branch) := by
  intro j
  exact pointed_seed_edge_of_common_model
    (chart (Fin.castSucc j)).carrier_open
    (chart (Fin.succ j)).carrier_open
    hleftOrd.z0_mem hrightOrd.z0_mem
    hleftOrd.eq_ord hrightOrd.eq_ord
```

The ordinary base limit is not derived from the terminal side lift.  It is the
genuine fixed `(4.1)` boundary-value theorem after the already checked CLE/test
pullback:

```lean
have hbaseOrd_coord :
    ∀ᶠ eps in l,
      I 0 eps =
        J * (∫ u : NPointDomain d n,
          BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
            (fun k μ =>
              (u k μ : Complex) +
                (eps : Complex) * (etaOrd k μ : Complex) * Complex.I) *
          (psiS : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u) := by
  -- Expand the first chart's local approach and `weight 0`.
  -- Use the fixed CLE/test pullback, `hpull_psi0Flat`, and the Jacobian
  -- formula for `BHW.os45CommonEdgeFlatCLE`.
  -- The proof must also establish the small-positive carrier membership in
  -- the incoming ordinary window on the support of `weight 0 eps`.

have hetaOrd : InForwardCone d n etaOrd := by

            (fun k μ =>
              (u k μ : Complex) +
                (eps : Complex) * (etaOrd k μ : Complex) * Complex.I) *
          (psiS : NPointDomain d n -> Complex) u)
      l (nhds Lpiece) := by
  have h41 :=
    ordinary41_fixed_test_boundaryValue_extendF OS lgc psiS etaOrd hetaOrd
  have hWick :

    simpa [Lpiece, psiS] using

have hbase :
    Tendsto (fun eps : Real => I 0 eps) l (nhds (J * Lpiece)) := by
  exact (hbaseOrd_raw.const_mul J).congr' hbaseOrd_coord.symm
```

The raw-adjacent instantiation is parallel but has a different incoming sheet:

```lean
-- chart 0: retained raw `(4.12)` seed at `gammaAdjSeed 0`.
obtain ⟨A0, hA0_center, hA0_mem, hA0_sub, hA0_model, hA0_trace⟩ :=

  exact (hbaseAdj_raw.const_mul J).congr' hbaseAdj_coord.symm
```

The terminal contract is also local.  In the ordinary selector,
`chart (Fin.last len)` has the ordinary common-edge model
`BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)`.  In the raw-adjacent selector,
`chart (Fin.last len)` is still reached through retained raw provenance; on the
eventual positive-height terminal support one first proves

```lean
have hterminalAdj_sheet :
    ∀ᶠ eps in l, ∀ x,
      x ∈ Function.support (psiFlatAdj eps : X -> Complex) ->
        BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ
          (sideLift (-1 : Real) eps eta0 x) ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n := by
  -- This is the terminal support-local sheet membership from the side
  -- support radius and the retained raw terminal chart.  It is not an
  -- incoming seed hypothesis.
```

Then `BHW.extendF_eq_on_forwardTube` rewrites the raw terminal branch to the
displayed `extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (BHW.permAct P.τ z)` form used by the
source-side DCT.

The terminal approach has a concrete form.  Define it locally; use it only for
the terminal chart and terminal normal-form rewrites unless the current edge's
approach contract has already been proved to be this expression.

```lean
let flatSide (sgn eps : Real)
    (eta x : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n) :
    BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartSpace d n :=
  fun a => (x a : Complex) + (((sgn * eps) • eta) a : Complex) * Complex.I

let sideLift (sgn eps : Real)
    (eta x : BHW.OS45FlatCommonChartReal d n) :
    Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> Complex :=
  (BHW.os45QuarterTurnCLE (d := d) (n := n)).symm
    (BHW.unflattenCfg n d (flatSide sgn eps eta x))

let psiFlatOrd (eps : Real) :=
  SCV.translateSchwartz (-(eps • eta0)) psiF

let psiFlatAdj (eps : Real) :=
  SCV.translateSchwartz (-((-eps) • eta0)) psiF
```

The compact-collar proof used at the terminal chart and at any edge with a
known chart-local approach is always the same pattern:

```lean

For the adjacent terminal collar replace `1` by `-1`, `eps • eta0` by
`(-eps) • eta0`, and `psiFlatOrd` by `psiFlatAdj`.

For each edge `j : Fin len`, first put both adjacent chart integrals into the
same local edge coordinates.  This is where any CLE/test pullback or
coordinate-change calculation for that edge is discharged; do not hide it in a
new branch packet.

```lean
let A := chart (Fin.castSucc j)
let B := chart (Fin.succ j)
let step := edge j

let edgeApproach : Real -> X -> Z := approach (Fin.castSucc j)
let edgeWeight : Real -> SchwartzMap X Complex := weight (Fin.castSucc j)

have hleft_to_edge :
    ∀ᶠ eps in l,
      I (Fin.castSucc j) eps =
        ∫ x : X, A.branch (edgeApproach eps x) * edgeWeight eps x := by
  -- Usually `rfl`; if the left chart uses a local CLE coordinate, expand that
  -- coordinate here and use the checked pullback equality for the fixed test.

      I (Fin.succ j) eps =
        ∫ x : X, B.branch (edgeApproach eps x) * edgeWeight eps x := by
  -- This is the edge-local coordinate contract.  On the fixed translated
  -- support it proves that the right chart is being evaluated at the same

  -- both sides are zero by `Function.mem_support`.

```

The finite induction transports the fixed boundary limit from chart `j` to
`j + 1` by `Tendsto.congr' hedge_integral_eq`.  This is where the identity
theorem is used.  A proof that only stores a small seed neighborhood and never
calls `PointedMetricBranchChart.eqOn_inter_of_seed` is incomplete.

The local induction should be written directly:

```lean
have hstep :
    ∀ j : Fin len,
      ∀ᶠ eps in l, I (Fin.castSucc j) eps = I (Fin.succ j) eps := by
  intro j
  -- inline the edge proof displayed above for this `j`.

have hchain :
    ∀ m : Nat, ∀ hm : m ≤ len,
      Tendsto
        (fun eps : Real => I ⟨m, Nat.lt_succ_of_le hm⟩ eps)
        l (nhds (J * Lpiece)) := by
  intro m hm
  induction m with
  | zero =>
      simpa using hbase
  | succ m ih =>
      have hm_le_len : m ≤ len := Nat.le_trans (Nat.le_succ m) hm
      have hm_lt_len : m < len := Nat.lt_of_succ_le hm
      let j : Fin len := ⟨m, hm_lt_len⟩
      have hprev :
          Tendsto
            (fun eps : Real => I (Fin.castSucc j) eps)
            l (nhds (J * Lpiece)) := by
        simpa [j] using ih hm_le_len
      exact hprev.congr' (hstep j)

have hlast :
    Tendsto (fun eps : Real => I (Fin.last len) eps)
      l (nhds (J * Lpiece)) := by
  simpa using hchain len le_rfl
```

After the finite induction reaches the terminal chart, prove the two terminal
normal forms before scalar cancellation:

```lean
let terminal := chart (Fin.last len)

have hterminal_slot_ord :
    ∀ᶠ eps in l,
      I (Fin.last len) eps =

  by_cases hx :

        (psiFlatAdj eps : X -> Complex)
  · have hz := hmem x hx
    have hraw :
        terminal.branch (sideLift (-1 : Real) eps eta0 x) =
          bvt_F OS lgc n
            (BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ
              (sideLift (-1 : Real) eps eta0 x)) := by

    have hF_eq :

              (sideLift (-1 : Real) eps eta0 x)) =
          bvt_F OS lgc n
            (BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ

      exact BHW.extendF_eq_on_forwardTube n (bvt_F OS lgc n)
        hF_holo hF_real_inv
        _ (hsheet x hx)
    have hmodel :
        terminal.branch (sideLift (-1 : Real) eps eta0 x) =
          BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
            (BHW.permAct (d := d) P.τ
              (sideLift (-1 : Real) eps eta0 x)) :=
      hraw.trans hF_eq.symm
    have hSigmaAdj_symm : sigmaAdj.symm = P.τ := by

    simp [FlatAdjPiece, sideLift, flatSide,

  · have hzero : psiFlatAdj eps x = 0 := by
      exact not_ne_iff.mp (by simpa [Function.mem_support] using hx)
    simp [hzero]
```

The selected fixed flat limits are then:

```lean
have hflatOrd_piece_a :
    Tendsto (FlatOrdPiece a) l (nhds (J * Lpiece)) :=
  hlast.congr' hterminal_to_flat_ord

have hflatAdj_piece_a :
    Tendsto (FlatAdjPiece a) l (nhds (J * Lpiece)) :=
  hlast.congr' hterminal_to_flat_adj
```

## Moving Test Status

The live goals contain moving side tests, but the active proof does not
transport those moving tests through the chart chain.  The fixed endpoint value
is selected first; then the checked moving endpoint DCT already present in the
Hdiff body changes the moving tests to the same endpoint.

Use the concrete Figure-2-4 cutoff facts for the moving endpoint DCT:

```lean
D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM_sub_toZeroDiagonalCLM_eq_zero_off_eventually
D.toSideZeroDiagonalCLM_sub_toZeroDiagonalCLM_seminorm_tendsto_zero
BHW.tendsto_integral_comp_os45FlatCommonChartSourceSide_mul_moving_of_commonCompactSupport
```

These facts take the original flat test `phi` and the source-window packet
`hφUsrc`; do not feed `psi0Flat` to them.  The auxiliary `psi0Flat` belongs
only to the fixed scalar-cancellation selector.

## Implementation Order

1. In `hOrd_side_current`, define `psi0Flat`, `OrdFixed`, and `OrdEndpoint`.
   Prove `hOrd_fixed_selected` by expanding the ordinary fixed flat selector;
   prove `hOrd_fixed_endpoint`; rewrite the existing `hOrd_endpoint_DCT`.
2. In `hAdj_side_current`, define `sigmaAdj`, `tauOut`, `AdjFixed`, and
   `AdjEndpoint`.  Prove `hAdj_fixed_selected` from the retained raw `(4.12)`
   fixed flat selector; prove `hAdj_fixed_endpoint`; rewrite the existing
   `hAdj_endpoint_DCT`.
3. Only after both moving current limits are closed may the downstream flat EOW
   seed, local common-boundary CLM, local `S'_n`, pair carrier, and later
   theorem-2 wrapper work resume.

## Remaining Proof-Doc Gate

The prior `etaBaseOrd/etaBaseAdj` route is rejected.  The direct
moving-current induction route is also rejected.  The remaining Lean-entry gate
is now the fixed flat translated-boundary selector:

```lean
hflatOrd_selected
hflatAdj_selected
hedge_integral_eq for each chart-local fixed selector edge
hterminal_to_flat_ord
hterminal_to_flat_adj
```

The surrounding fixed endpoint DCT, moving endpoint DCT, scalar cancellation,
inverse-CLE support, and Schwinger normalization facts already have checked
support theorems or local proof scripts in the frontier file.  The hard proof
body is the finite one-branch selector itself.

## Latest Common-Partition Packet

The frontier now has the checked static Wick-endpoint packet
`fixedApproach_integral_eq_sum_chart_partition` and the stronger paired packet
`fixed_sourceSide_integral_common_chart_partition`.

The paired packet chooses one finite Schwartz partition subordinate to a
single common open cover and proves both:

```lean
∫ Astatic.branch (staticApproach u) * w u
  =
∑ c, ∫ (Bstatic c).branch (staticApproach u) * piece c u
```

and

```lean
(fun eps =>
  ∫ Amoving.branch (sourceSide eps u) * w u)
  =ᶠ[l]
fun eps =>
  ∑ c, ∫ (Bmoving c).branch (sourceSide eps u) * piece c u
```

This is the non-mismatched endpoint transport shape needed for the ordinary
selector: the Wick retargeting and source-side retargeting can now share the
same localized pieces after a common refinement of their carrier preimages.

A body-level attempt to retain the ordinary common-refinement facts inside
`hOrdPieceFixed_selected` checked locally but reintroduced deterministic
downstream elaboration timeouts.  It was backed out.  The next implementation
should consume `fixed_sourceSide_integral_common_chart_partition` only inside a
completed selector subproof whose exported result is the limit statement, not
as extra persistent local data in the open producer context.

Fresh exact check:

```bash
lake env lean -DmaxHeartbeats=1200000 OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45Figure24Hdiff.lean
```

Log: `/tmp/osr_hdiff_common_partition_stable_1779258600.log`.

Result: exit code `1`, with only the two intended selector goals at
`Hdiff.lean:5717:64` (`hOrdPieceFixed_selected`) and `Hdiff.lean:8589:58`
(`hAdjPieceFixed_selected`); no timeout diagnostics.

Follow-up refinement: `fixed_sourceSide_integral_refined_chart_partition` now
takes separate finite Wick-endpoint and source-endpoint chart covers and
constructs the product common refinement internally.  This avoids materializing
the product cover in the giant theorem context.  Its output pieces are indexed
by `α × β`, supported in `Ustatic α ∩ Umoving β`, and carry both retargeted
endpoint equations against those same pieces.

Fresh exact check after this refinement:

```bash
lake env lean -DmaxHeartbeats=1200000 OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45Figure24Hdiff.lean
```

Log: `/tmp/osr_hdiff_refined_partition_1779260400.log`.

Result: exit code `1`, with only the two intended selector goals at
`Hdiff.lean:5813:64` (`hOrdPieceFixed_selected`) and `Hdiff.lean:8685:58`
(`hAdjPieceFixed_selected`); no timeout diagnostics.

Latest limit-level refinement: `fixed_sourceSide_integral_refined_chart_partition_tendsto_of_local`
now consumes the refined product partition internally and exports the actual
limit transport.  Its remaining premise is the honest localized comparison:
for every product-refined piece supported in `Ustatic cs ∩ Umoving cm`, the
source-side branch integral in chart `Bmoving cm` must tend to the static Wick
integral in chart `Bstatic cs`.  Under that premise, the helper proves the
whole `Amoving` source-side integral tends to the whole `Astatic` Wick
integral, using the same partition pieces for both sides and then summing the
localized limits.

This pins the next mathematical gap more sharply: partition construction,
support collars, integrability, and chart retargeting are now checked outside
the giant producer context.  What remains for the ordinary selector is the
localized boundary-value comparison on each refined support piece.

Fresh exact check after the limit-level refinement:

```bash
lake env lean -DmaxHeartbeats=1200000 OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45Figure24Hdiff.lean
```

Log: `/tmp/osr_hdiff_limit_refinement_1779265000.log`.

Result: exit code `1`, with only the two intended selector goals at
`Hdiff.lean:5915:64` (`hOrdPieceFixed_selected`) and `Hdiff.lean:8787:58`
(`hAdjPieceFixed_selected`); no timeout diagnostics.
