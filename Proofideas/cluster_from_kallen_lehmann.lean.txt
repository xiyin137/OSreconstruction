# Cluster decomposition from Källén-Lehmann (RETIRED)

**Status (2026-05-06)**: parked in `Proofideas/`. The cluster theorem
`W_analytic_cluster_integral` was closed via the Ruelle 1962 route in
`OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/RuelleClusterBound.lean`,
making this spectral / KL derivation no longer required.

Has 9 sorrys + open issues (existential bundling, OS time reflection,
vacuum bridge, AC marginal — see `docs/cluster_axiom_vetting.md`
Issues 1–4) that would each take substantial work to resolve. Preserved
here as architectural reference in case a future state-specific spectral
derivation is wanted (mass gap, asymptotic completeness, particle
interpretation — applications where the KL representation is needed
beyond cluster).

The KL primitives used here (`kallen_lehmann_representation`,
`vacuum_spectral_measure_W2`, etc.) live in production at
`OSReconstruction/Wightman/Spectral/KallenLehmann.lean`.

# Cluster decomposition from Källén-Lehmann

This file demonstrates the **architecture** for closing the Schwinger cluster
theorem (`W_analytic_cluster_integral`) via the spectral / Källén-Lehmann
route.

The previous route (i) attempt (dominated convergence in position-space
coordinates) was blocked by a polynomial-in-`|⃗a|` factor in the joint kernel
bound that Schwartz decay couldn't absorb (see
`docs/cluster_obstacle_and_options.md`). The spectral approach bypasses this:
the cluster integral is rewritten as a Fourier integral against the spectral
measure, where the kernel `e^{-i ⃗a · ⃗p}` is bounded by 1 (not polynomially
growing), and Riemann-Lebesgue handles the asymptotic.

## The chain

Granting four named building blocks (each either provable from Mathlib, a
clean textbook axiom with citation, or already proved in our codebase):

1. `kallen_lehmann_representation` — spectral measure of `W_2`. **Proved**
   in `KallenLehmann.lean` (granting SNAG + Bochner + axioms A, B).
2. `spectral_riemann_lebesgue_no_zero_atom` — for finite Borel `ν` on
   `ℝ^{d+1}` with `ν({p : p_spatial = 0}) = 0`, the spatial Fourier integral
   `∫ exp(i ⃗a · ⃗p) dν → 0` as `|⃗a| → ∞`. **Provable from Mathlib**
   (`tendsto_integral_exp_inner_smul_cocompact` + decomposition into
   absolutely-continuous and atomic parts; the no-atom hypothesis ensures
   no oscillating-but-nondecaying contributions).
3. `wickRotatedIntegral_eq_laplaceFourier_spectralIntegral` — for
   OPTR-supported `f`, the Wick-rotated integral
   `∫ F_ext_total Wfn (wick x) f(x) dx` equals the Laplace-Fourier
   transform of `f` paired with the spectral measure of `W_2`. **Textbook**
   (Glimm-Jaffe §6.2; Streater-Wightman §3.4); a clean Lean discharge uses
   `Wfn.spectrum_condition` + Bochner integral manipulation.
4. `truncated_spectral_no_zero_spatial_atom` — the spatial marginal of the
   truncated spectral measure has no atom at `⃗p = 0`. **Textbook
   consequence of R4 + spectrum condition**, equivalent to the
   distributional cluster axiom in spectral form.

## Status

This file proves the **2-point case** of `W_analytic_cluster_integral`
end-to-end granting the four building blocks. The general n,m case
requires the truncated decomposition for higher-point functions
(combinatorial, ~few hundred lines).

The proof shows that the spectral approach **mathematically works** —
no polynomial-growth obstruction.

/-! ### Building block 2: Spectral Riemann-Lebesgue with no-atom condition -/

/-- **Spectral Riemann-Lebesgue**: the spatial Fourier transform of a finite
positive Borel measure on `SpacetimeDim d` whose spatial marginal has no
atom at `⃗p = 0` tends to zero as the spatial parameter goes to infinity.

**Provable from Mathlib**: decompose the spatial marginal into absolutely
continuous + singular continuous + atomic parts. The atomic part has a
finite collection of point masses; under the no-atom-at-0 condition, each
nonzero atom contributes an oscillating term that does NOT decay — so we
need to assume no atoms in the *spatial* marginal at all (not just at 0)
for full RL. The standard form: spatial marginal absolutely continuous
gives `tendsto_integral_exp_inner_smul_cocompact` (Mathlib
`Mathlib/Analysis/Fourier/RiemannLebesgueLemma.lean:180`).

For the cluster application, we use a stronger condition that holds for the
truncated spectral measure: the spatial marginal has an L¹ density, so
Riemann-Lebesgue applies directly. -/

/-! ### Building block 3: Wick-rotated integral as Laplace-Fourier transform -/

/-- **Spectral representation of the Wick-rotated 2-point Schwinger integral.**

For OPTR-supported test functions `f, g : SchwartzSpacetime d`, the
2-point Wick-rotated boundary integral equals the bilinear pairing of
their Laplace-Fourier transforms against the **universal** vacuum
spectral measure of `W_2`:
$$\int F_\text{ext}(\text{wick}(\text{append}\,x_n\,x_m))\, f(x_n)\,
  g(x_m)\, dx_n\, dx_m =
  \int_{V^+} \widetilde f_E(p)\, \overline{\widetilde g_E(p)}\, d\rho(p),$$
where:
* `\widetilde f_E(p) := \int e^{-p^0 t + i \vec p \cdot \vec x} f(t, \vec x)\, dt\, d\vec x`
  is the Schwinger Laplace-in-time / Fourier-in-space transform of `f`
  (well-defined for OPTR-supported `f`, where times are positive so the
  Laplace integral converges).
* `\rho` is the **universal** vacuum spectral measure of `W_2` (independent
  of any test function), characterized by
  `\Wfn.W 2(g.osConj.tensorProduct g) = \int |\widetilde g_M(p)|^2 d\rho(p)`
  for all `g`.

**Vetting note (2026-05-04, Gemini chat)**: an earlier version of this
axiom incorrectly stated the conclusion in terms of `Wfn.W 1` (the
1-point distribution) and used the `f`-smeared spectral measure instead
of the universal `\rho`. Both errors fixed: this version uses the
universal spectral measure and correctly states the 2-point bilinear
identity, matching Glimm-Jaffe §6.2 and Streater-Wightman §3.4 exactly.

**Discharge**: from `Wfn.spectrum_condition` (R3) + spectral representation
of `W_2` extended by analytic continuation. OPTR support of `f, g`
ensures the Laplace transform converges (positive ordered times).

/-! ### Building block 4: Truncated spectral has no spatial-zero atom -/

/-- **No spatial-zero atom in truncated spectral measure** (consequence of R4).

The truncated spectral measure `ν := μ - |W_1(f)|² · δ_0` has no atom on
the time-axis `{(p^0, 0) : p^0 ≥ 0}`. Equivalently, the spatial marginal
of `ν` has no atom at `⃗p = 0`, and indeed is absolutely continuous on the
relevant slices (by the spectral support analysis from R3 + R4).

**Discharge**: This is the spectral form of R4 cluster — equivalent
content. From `Wfn.cluster` (R4 distributional cluster) + spectrum
condition R3, the truncated spectral measure has no point masses on the
time axis above the origin (the only zero-spatial-momentum atom is the
vacuum, which is at `p = 0` and subtracted by truncation).

/-! ### Bridge: spectral cluster → Wick-rotated integral cluster -/

/-- **2-point Wick-rotated integral cluster from KL** (the actual target).

For OPTR-supported `f, g : SchwartzSpacetime d`, the Wick-rotated boundary
integral satisfies cluster decomposition as `|⃗a| → ∞`:
$$\Big| \int F_\text{ext}(\text{wick}\,x)\,(f \otimes g_a)(x)\,dx
  - \Big(\int F_\text{ext}(\text{wick}\,x_n) f(x_n)\,dx_n\Big)
    \Big(\int F_\text{ext}(\text{wick}\,x_m) g(x_m)\,dx_m\Big)\Big| \to 0.$$

**Proof granting** the four building blocks. Combines:
- `wickRotatedIntegral_eq_laplaceFourier_spectralIntegral` to express both
  sides in terms of the spectral measure.
- `kallen_lehmann_representation` for the spectral structure of `W_2`.
- `spectral_riemann_lebesgue` (after `truncated_spectral_no_zero_spatial_atom`)
  for the asymptotic decay of the spatial Fourier integral.

The polynomial-growth obstruction from route (i) does NOT appear here:
the spectral kernel `e^{-i ⃗a · ⃗p}` is bounded by 1, not polynomial in `|⃗a|`.

This demonstrates that the spectral / KL approach **mathematically works**.

/-! ### General n, m via truncated decomposition

To extend `cluster_2point_from_KL` to general n, m, we use the
**truncated/connected decomposition** of Wightman functions. The cluster
theorem for n+m-point integrals reduces to cluster of each truncated
piece, each of which has a spectral Fourier representation analogous to
the 2-point case.

## Truncated decomposition

For each n ≥ 1, there exist truncated functions `W^T_n : SchwartzNPoint d n → ℂ`
satisfying the partition decomposition:
$$W_n(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \sum_{\pi \in \text{Partitions}(\{1,\ldots,n\})}
  \prod_{B \in \pi} W^T_{|B|}(x_B)$$
where the sum is over all set partitions of `{1, ..., n}`. By Möbius
inversion on the partition lattice, this uniquely determines `W^T_n`
in terms of `W_1, W_2, ..., W_n`.

The truncated functions satisfy:
* `W^T_1 = W_1`.
* `W^T_2(x_1, x_2) = W_2(x_1, x_2) - W_1(x_1) W_1(x_2)`.
* `W^T_n` is symmetric under index permutations (BHW symmetry).
* **Cluster property**: `W^T_n(x_1, ..., x_n)` is "small at infinity" —
  vanishes (in distributional sense) as any cluster of points is moved
  spatially to infinity, with the rest fixed.

This is pure combinatorics over `Finset.partitions`; the basic file
`Mathlib/Combinatorics/Partition.lean` and
`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SetFamily/Partition.lean` provide infrastructure.
~few hundred lines to define + verify the inversion.

## Spectral cluster for n-point truncated

For each n ≥ 2, there's a spectral representation of `W^T_n` analogous to
the 2-point KL representation:
$$W^T_n(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \int_{(V^+)^{n-1}} e^{-i \sum_k p_k \cdot (x_{k+1} - x_k)}
  \, d\rho^T_n(p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1})$$
where `\rho^T_n` is the **truncated n-point spectral measure** on `(V⁺)^{n-1}`.
The R4 cluster of `W_n` distributions is equivalent to the absence of
zero-momentum atoms in `\rho^T_n` (in the appropriate sense for clustering
across the chosen partition of points).

## The general cluster theorem

`cluster_npoint_from_KL`: for OPTR-supported `f : SchwartzNPoint d n`,
`g : SchwartzNPoint d m`, the Wick-rotated boundary integral satisfies
cluster decomposition.

Proof (granting truncated decomposition + spectral cluster for each n-point
truncated):
1. Decompose `(f ⊗ g_a)`-tensor evaluation of `W_{n+m}` via partitions.
2. Identify the disconnected piece (partitions that don't connect n-block to
   m-block) with the RHS `(∫_n)(∫_m)` after spatial translation invariance.
3. The connecting pieces (partitions with at least one block spanning both
   halves) involve truncated functions `W^T_k` with k ≥ 2, evaluated on
   mixed configurations. Each contributes a spatial Fourier integral against
   a truncated spectral measure; each → 0 by the no-zero-spatial-momentum-atom
   property.
4. Sum: total → 0 as `|⃗a| → ∞`.

The scaffolding below shows this architecture; the proofs are deferred. -/

/-- **Truncated Wightman functions** (combinatorial structure).

For any Wightman QFT `Wfn`, there's an associated family of truncated
n-point functions `W^T_k` related to `W_k` by Möbius inversion over the
partition lattice. -/

  W^T_{|B|}(\bigotimes_{i \in B} g_i),$$

where the sum is over all set partitions `π` of `{1, ..., n}`.

test functions by linearity + density of factorizable tensors in

/-! **NOTE (2026-05-04, Gemini vetting)**: an earlier draft included
two axioms `truncated_npoint_spectral_representation` and
`truncated_spectral_spatialFourier_decay` claiming the existence of
spectral *measures* `ρ^T_n` for higher-point truncated functions
`W^T_n` with n ≥ 3. **Both are mathematically FALSE.** For n ≥ 3,
the truncated function `W^T_n` does NOT possess a Borel spectral
measure — only the 2-point case does (via positivity
`‖φ(f)Ω‖² ≥ 0`). For n ≥ 3, the Fourier transform of `W^T_n` is a
tempered *distribution*, not a measure.

The correct textbook proof (Glimm-Jaffe §19.4; Ruelle's cluster
theorem) uses **Wightman GNS Hilbert-space operator theory**, not
n-point spectral measures. The right axiom set involves:
* Wightman GNS construction (`H, Ω, φ, U(a)`).
* SNAG applied to translation unitaries `U(a)` to get a joint PVM.
* Schwinger ↔ GNS bridge: Wick-rotated integral as `⟨Ψ, U(a) Φ⟩`.
* Vacuum atom subtraction → truncated state-specific spectral measure.
* Riemann-Lebesgue on the state-specific measure.

The two axioms below replace the false ones with the
correct GNS-based approach. -/

/-! ### Class-based Wightman GNS reconstruction

Per Gemini vetting (2026-05-04), the existential-bundling approach for
the GNS bridge is an antipattern: each `(f, g)` pair would generate a
different, unrelated Hilbert space at the type level. Replaced with a
typeclass parameterized by `Wfn`, ensuring all sub-claims refer to the
**same** reconstructed Hilbert space.

This class also incorporates the OS time reflection (`osConj`) on the
Schwinger bridge to avoid the **domain escape** issue (`F_ext` is
undefined where imaginary parts of consecutive points cross zero —
which they would for two OPTR-supported test functions concatenated
without time reflection). -/

/-- **Wightman GNS reconstruction class**.

For a Wightman QFT `Wfn`, the GNS reconstruction provides:
* A Hilbert space `H`.
* A normalized vacuum `Ω : H` invariant under translations.
* A "quantization" map sending OPTR-supported Schwartz test functions
  to states in `H`.
* A strongly continuous unitary translation group `U(a) : H → H`.

The Schwinger bridge identifies the Wick-rotated boundary integral
(applied to the OS-reflected tensor product `f.osConj ⊗ g_a`) with the
GNS inner product `⟨Ψ_f, U(a) Ψ_g⟩`. The OS reflection ensures the
joint config has strictly time-ordered (negative-then-positive) imaginary
parts, so `F_ext` is well-defined.

  /-- **Schwinger bridge** (with OS time reflection):

      For OPTR-supported `f, g`, the Wick-rotated boundary integral against
      `f.osConj ⊗ g_a` equals the GNS inner product `⟨Ψ_f, U(a) Ψ_g⟩`.
      The OS reflection on `f` flips its time support to negative-and-decreasing,
      so the appended `(f̃, g_a)` config has globally time-ordered imaginary
      parts (negative for f̃-block, positive for g_a-block), making `F_ext`
      well-defined.

  /-- **Spatial decay of matrix elements on the orthogonal complement of `Ω`.**

      For any pair of states `ψ, φ ∈ H` orthogonal to the vacuum, the matrix
      element `⟨ψ, U(a) φ⟩` decays to 0 as the spatial part of `a` goes to
      infinity (along the cobounded filter on `Fin d → ℝ`).

      This is the cluster-decay consequence of:
      * The joint spectral measure `μ_{ψ,φ}` (from SNAG applied to `U`)
        being supported on mass hyperboloids `p² ≥ m²` (no zero-spatial-momentum
        atom on the vacuum-orthogonal complement, by `vacuum_unique`),
      * which gives a Lebesgue-AC spatial marginal,
      * combined with Riemann-Lebesgue.

      Per Gemini vetting: stating the decay consequence directly is cleaner
      than carrying around a `Measure.map ≪ volume` placeholder for the SNAG
      output. It is exactly the Hilbert-space-side fact that, together with
      `vac_inv` + `vacuum_unique`, lets us conclude cluster decomposition by
      orthogonal decomposition `Ψ = ⟨Ω,Ψ⟩Ω + Ψ⊥` and decay of the `⊥`-`⊥` term.

For the truncated n-point function `W^T_n`, when one cluster of m points
is moved spatially to infinity, the truncated function vanishes. This is
the spectral form of R4 cluster, generalizing
`truncated_spectral_no_zero_spatial_atom` to higher-point.

**Discharge**: from R4 + analogous spectral analysis of `W^T_n`. Each
`W^T_n` has a spectral representation on `(V^+)^{n-1}` (or analogous

/-! ### Architectural conclusion

The proof of `cluster_npoint_from_KL` granting the named building blocks
demonstrates that the spectral / Källén-Lehmann route to Schwinger
cluster is **mathematically sound** for the FULL `W_analytic_cluster_integral`
statement (not just 2-point).

## Discharge cost summary

| Building block | Status | Lines (estimated) |
|---|---|---|
| `kallen_lehmann_representation` | **PROVED** | (already done) |
| `spectral_riemann_lebesgue` | sorry/axiom | ~50 (Mathlib-derivable) |
| `wickRotatedIntegral_eq_laplaceFourier_spectralIntegral` | textbook axiom | ~200 (or accept as axiom) |
| `WightmanTruncated_exists` | textbook axiom | ~300 (combinatorial) |
| `truncated_npoint_cluster` | textbook axiom | ~100 |
| `spectralFunction_cluster` proof | sorry | ~50 |

| `cluster_npoint_from_KL` proof | sorry | ~300 |
| **Replace** `W_analytic_cluster_integral` to invoke `cluster_npoint_from_KL` | ~5 lines |
| **Total proved/discharged** | | **~1100-1500 lines** |

vs. **Route (i) blocked** by the polynomial-growth obstruction with no
discharge path.

## What's "scaffolded" vs "proved"

- **Architecturally scaffolded** (compiles, `lake build` clean): every
  building block is named with a precise type signature; every theorem
  has the right statement.
- **Mathematically validated**: the proof chain works. The polynomial-
  growth obstruction does NOT appear in spectral coordinates.
- **Lean-level discharge remaining**: ~1100-1500 lines distributed
  across sorrys (or textbook axioms with citation, per the project's
  axiom-management discipline).

The decision (axiomatize textbook content vs. prove from R0–R4) is the
user's call. Either way, the cluster theorem can be closed via this
spectral route. -/

/-! ### Route A: GNS-class cluster

Per the round-2 Gemini vetting (2026-05-04), the `WightmanReconstruction`
class plus pure Hilbert-space orthogonal decomposition closes cluster
**without** any of the Route-B spectral chain (no `kallen_lehmann_representation`,
no `spectral_riemann_lebesgue`, no truncated decomposition, no
`truncated_npoint_cluster`).

The proof:
1. Decompose `ψ = ⟨Ω, ψ⟩ • Ω + ψ⊥` (orthogonal projection onto Ω-line),
   similarly `φ = ⟨Ω, φ⟩ • Ω + φ⊥`.
2. By `vac_inv` (`U(a) Ω = Ω`) and unitarity (`U(a)*Ω = Ω`):
   `⟨ψ, U(a) φ⟩ = ⟨ψ, Ω⟩⟨Ω, φ⟩ + ⟨ψ⊥, U(a) φ⊥⟩`.
3. The cross term `⟨ψ⊥, U(a) φ⊥⟩ → 0` directly by
   `truncated_spatial_decay` (the orthogonal-complement field).
4. The integral form follows by applying `schwinger_bridge` to the joint
   integral and `vacuum_expectation` to each block. -/

/-- **Cluster decomposition for inner products** (the master theorem).

For any pair of states `ψ, φ` in the GNS Hilbert space:
$$⟨ψ, U(a) φ⟩ \to ⟨ψ, Ω⟩ \cdot ⟨Ω, φ⟩ \quad \text{as } |\vec a| \to \infty$$
along the spatial cobounded filter (`a^0 = 0`, `|⃗a| → ∞`).

This is the "Hilbert-space-side" cluster theorem. The integral-side
cluster (matching `W_analytic_cluster_integral`) is a corollary,
obtained by applying `WR.schwinger_bridge` and `WR.vacuum_expectation`
to convert each inner product into a Wick-rotated Schwinger integral.

**Proof structure**:

* Decompose `ψ = c_ψ • Ω + ψ⊥` where `c_ψ := ⟨Ω, ψ⟩`, `ψ⊥ := ψ - c_ψ•Ω`.
  Then `⟨Ω, ψ⊥⟩ = 0` (orthogonality of the projection).
* Similarly `φ = c_φ • Ω + φ⊥` with `⟨Ω, φ⊥⟩ = 0`.
* `⟨ψ, U(a) φ⟩ = ⟨c_ψ•Ω + ψ⊥, U(a)(c_φ•Ω + φ⊥)⟩`
              `= conj(c_ψ) · c_φ · ⟨Ω, U(a) Ω⟩`     (vacuum-vacuum term)
              ` + conj(c_ψ) · ⟨Ω, U(a) φ⊥⟩`         (cross 1)
              ` + c_φ · ⟨ψ⊥, U(a) Ω⟩`               (cross 2)
              ` + ⟨ψ⊥, U(a) φ⊥⟩`                    (orthogonal piece)
* Vacuum-vacuum: `U(a) Ω = Ω` (`vac_inv`), so this is `conj(c_ψ) c_φ ‖Ω‖² = conj(c_ψ) c_φ`.
* Cross 1: `⟨Ω, U(a) φ⊥⟩ = ⟨U(a)* Ω, φ⊥⟩ = ⟨Ω, φ⊥⟩ = 0` (using unitarity
  of `U(a)` + `vac_inv`, which gives `U(a)*Ω = Ω`).
* Cross 2: `⟨ψ⊥, U(a) Ω⟩ = ⟨ψ⊥, Ω⟩ = (⟨Ω, ψ⊥⟩)* = 0`.
* Orthogonal piece: `⟨ψ⊥, U(a) φ⊥⟩ → 0` by
  `WR.truncated_spatial_decay` applied to `(ψ⊥, φ⊥)` (which are both
  ⊥ Ω by construction).
* Sum: `⟨ψ, U(a) φ⟩ → conj(c_ψ) c_φ = ⟨ψ, Ω⟩ ⟨Ω, φ⟩`.

The proof is ~50 lines of pure inner-product algebra in Lean once
fleshed out; the SUBSTANCE is `WR.truncated_spatial_decay` doing the
analytic work. -/

/-! #### Bridge to integral form

The integral-form cluster (matching `W_analytic_cluster_integral`) is
obtained from `cluster_inner_product_from_GNS` by applying:

* `WR.schwinger_bridge` on the joint integral, converting
  `∫ F_ext (f.osConj ⊗ g_a) = ⟨quantize f, U(a) quantize g⟩`.
* `WR.vacuum_expectation` on each block:
  `⟨Ω, quantize f⟩ = ∫ F_ext f`,
  `⟨Ω, quantize g⟩ = ∫ F_ext g`.
* The conjugate-linearity of the inner product to express
  `⟨quantize f, Ω⟩ = (⟨Ω, quantize f⟩)*`.

The result is cluster of the **OS-reflected** integral
(`∫ F_ext (f.osConj ⊗ g_a) → (∫ F_ext f)* · (∫ F_ext g)`), which is
the natural form coming out of OS quantization. The pre-existing
`cluster_2point_from_KL` and `cluster_npoint_from_KL` theorems target
the un-reflected form; closing the un-reflected form requires either
modifying their signatures to use `f.osConj` on the bra side, or
adding a separate bridge axiom relating the reflected and un-reflected
joint integrals on OPTR-supported test functions.

This bridge is left as concrete Lean engineering on top of the named
class fields — no new mathematical content is needed. -/

/-! #### Integral-form wrapper -/

/-- **OS-reflected n-point cluster, integral form** (Route A).

For OPTR-supported `f, g`, the Wick-rotated boundary integral against
the OS-reflected joint config `f.osConj ⊗ g_a` clusters to the product
of GNS inner products with the vacuum, as `|⃗a| → ∞` spatially.

This is the integral-form lift of `cluster_inner_product_from_GNS`.
The proof structure:

1. Apply `cluster_inner_product_from_GNS` to `(quantize f, quantize g)`.
   This gives `⟨ψ_f, U(a) ψ_g⟩ → ⟨ψ_f, Ω⟩ * ⟨Ω, ψ_g⟩`.
2. Rewrite `⟨ψ_f, U(a) ψ_g⟩` in the LHS function via
   `WR.schwinger_bridge`, converting it to
   `∫ F_ext (f.osConj ⊗ g_a)`.

The limit value here is deliberately left in inner-product form. A
separate corollary can rewrite it to integrals via `WR.vacuum_expectation`
plus `inner_conj_symm` (the bra-side conjugate flip). -/

/-! #### Architectural conclusion (Route A)

`cluster_inner_product_from_GNS` proves cluster decomposition entirely
within the `WightmanReconstruction` class — the analytic content is
isolated in `WR.truncated_spatial_decay`, and everything else is
algebra over ℂ-Hilbert spaces. **As of 2026-05-04 it is sorry-free.**

This **strictly subsumes** Route B for the cluster critical path:
- No need for `kallen_lehmann_representation` (still proved as
  reusable infrastructure).
- No need for `wickRotated_W2_eq_laplaceFourier_spectralIntegral`,
  `WightmanTruncated_decomposition_formula`, `truncated_npoint_cluster`,
  or `truncated_spectral_no_zero_spatial_atom`.
- No need for `spectral_riemann_lebesgue` (the Riemann-Lebesgue content
  is bundled into `truncated_spatial_decay` directly).

Remaining work toward the project's main target
`W_analytic_cluster_integral` (`SchwingerAxioms.lean:3786`):

1. **`cluster_npoint_OS_form`** — the integral-form wrapper proved via
   `WR.schwinger_bridge` (joint integral) + `WR.vacuum_expectation`
   (each block) + `inner_conj_symm` (bra-side conjugate flip).
   Mechanical given the class.

2. **Theorem surface choice**: the current `W_analytic_cluster_integral`
   uses `f.tensorProduct g_a` (un-reflected); Route A naturally gives
   the OS-reflected `f.osConj.tensorProduct g_a` form. Two options:
   either change the target's signature to the reflected form, or
   add an explicit osConj-to-no-osConj bridge.

3. **`WightmanReconstruction` instance** — without one, Route A is
   conditional on "given GNS data exists". Either the full Wightman
   GNS construction from R0–R4, or a textbook axiom set with
   citations. See `docs/cluster_routeA_plan.md`. -/
