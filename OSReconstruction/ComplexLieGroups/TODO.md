## Remaining Sorries — Analysis

### `blocker_isConnected_permSeedSet_nontrivial` (PermutationFlowBlocker.lean:55)

**Goal:** For nontrivial σ with n ≥ 2, the permutation seed set
`permSeedSet n σ = {Λ ∈ CLG : Λ·w ∈ FT ∩ σFT for some w}` is connected.

**Numerical status:** Supported in all 80 trials (d=1, n=2). Earlier mixed results
were a sampling artifact (missing valid boost range).

### `blocker_iterated_eow_hExtPerm_d1_nontrivial` (PermutationFlowBlocker.lean:91)

**Goal:** For d=1, if F satisfies BHW hypotheses and z, σ·z ∈ ExtendedTube,
then extendF F (σ·z) = extendF F z.

**Numerical status:** No numerical falsifier detected. Relative antisymmetry defect
< 10⁻¹² on sampled domain.

**Note:** `PermutationFlow.lean` is now fully sorry-free. The sorry that was previously
at `iterated_eow_permutation_extension` has been resolved. The two remaining sorries
are isolated in `PermutationFlowBlocker.lean` as deferred geometric obligations.

## Remaining Infrastructure

### `orbitSet_isPreconnected` (geometric)

**Goal:** O_w = {Λ ∈ G : Λ·w ∈ FT} is preconnected for each w ∈ FT.

**Why needed:** `nonemptyDomain_isPreconnected` reduces to this via
`isPreconnected_sUnion`, and `complex_lorentz_invariance` needs it.

**Status:**
- Resolved for `d = 0` (trivial group case) and `d = 1` (via `D1OrbitSet.lean`)
- Remaining open branch: `d ≥ 2` on the one-point orbit theorem (`n = 1`)
- Reduced to: preconnectedness of quadric-cone slices
  `hquad_nonreal : ∀ c ≠ 0, c.im ≠ 0 → IsPreconnected (quadricConeSet_wScalarE0 c)`

**Approaches:** See `Proofideas/complex_lorentz_invariance.lean` for detailed analysis.

### `iterated_eow_permutation_extension` — RESOLVED

The sorry that was previously at `PermutationFlow.lean` has been fully resolved.
The remaining obligations are isolated in `PermutationFlowBlocker.lean`:
1. `blocker_isConnected_permSeedSet_nontrivial` — seed-set connectivity
2. `blocker_iterated_eow_hExtPerm_d1_nontrivial` — d=1 overlap invariance

Both are numerically supported with no falsifiers detected.

## Difficulty Assessment and Formalization Effort

| Sorry | Difficulty | Est. effort | Used by |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `blocker_isConnected_permSeedSet_nontrivial` | Hard | 3-5 months | Both d ≥ 2 and d = 1 branches |
| `blocker_iterated_eow_hExtPerm_d1_nontrivial` | Medium-Hard | 2-4 months | d = 1 branch only |

### `blocker_isConnected_permSeedSet_nontrivial` — Hard

This is a purely geometric/topological statement — no analytic data involved. But the geometry
is intricate:
- The extended tube ET is the union of complex Lorentz orbits of the forward tube
- The intersection `permSeedSet = ET ∩ σ⁻¹-PermutedForwardTube` is a semi-algebraic subset
  of high-dimensional complex space
- Connectedness requires showing path-connectedness through this intersection

Proof approach would involve:
1. Showing the extended tube is path-connected (known: complex Lorentz group is connected)
2. Showing the intersection with the permuted forward tube is "thick enough" to remain connected
   — requires understanding the geometry of Lorentz orbits and how permutations interact with
   the cone structure
3. The numerical validation supports the assertion for d=1, n=2 but the general case needs a
   geometric argument

This is the **higher-priority** blocker since it is shared by both the d ≥ 2 and d = 1 branches.

### `blocker_iterated_eow_hExtPerm_d1_nontrivial` — Medium-Hard

This is specifically the d = 1 case of permutation invariance of the BHW extension. For d ≥ 2
this is handled by the Jost-point argument (real spacelike points in ET where local commutativity
applies directly). For d = 1 the Jost-point approach breaks down because:
- In 1+1 dimensions, the spatial part is 1-dimensional, so spacelike separation is weaker
- The complex Lorentz group SO⁺(1,1;ℂ) ≅ ℂ* is abelian, changing the orbit geometry
- The proof likely needs a direct analytic continuation argument specific to the d = 1 rapidity
  parametrization

### Comparison with Other Modules

These are qualitatively different from the SCV axioms — they are geometric/combinatorial arguments
about complex Lorentz orbits and tube domains, not deep functional analysis theorems. They do not
require new Mathlib infrastructure; the challenge is purely in the geometric reasoning about
high-dimensional semi-algebraic sets.

## Execution Order

1. **PermutationFlowBlocker.lean** — close the 2 remaining sorries (geometric obligations)
2. Build: `lake build OSReconstruction.ComplexLieGroups`
3. Only after (1)-(2): continue into `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/*`
   blockers that depend on BHW closure.
