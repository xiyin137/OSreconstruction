/-- W_analytic inherits real Lorentz invariance from the Wightman distribution.

    Both z ↦ W_analytic(z) and z ↦ W_analytic(Λz) are holomorphic on the forward tube
    with the same distributional boundary values (by Lorentz invariance of W_n).
    By `distributional_uniqueness_forwardTube`, they agree on the forward tube.

/-- W_analytic extends continuously to the real boundary of the forward tube.

    Proved using `continuous_boundary_forwardTube`: the distributional boundary value
    condition from `spectrum_condition` provides the hypothesis.

/-- The distributional boundary values of W_analytic and W_analytic composed with
    swap(i, i+1) agree when evaluated against test functions supported on configurations
    where x_{i+1} - x_i is spacelike. This is the distributional form of local
    commutativity, combining `hLC` with `hBV`.

    Blocked by: verifying that swapping indices in the forward tube approximation
    yields an approximation from the correct direction (the i-th cone direction
    flips sign under swap, requiring the backward cone). -/

/-- Pointwise local commutativity of the analytic continuation at spacelike boundary.

    g(z) = W_analytic(swap(z)) - W_analytic(z) is holomorphic where defined.
    By `W_analytic_swap_distributional_agree`, g has zero distributional boundary
    values at real spacelike points. By the edge-of-the-wedge theorem (sorry-free
    in `EdgeOfWedge.lean`), g extends holomorphically across the boundary.
    Since g = 0 distributionally on an open real set, the identity theorem gives g = 0.

    Blocked by: multi-tube EOW application (expressing the forward and swapped tubes
    as tube domains) and the distributional-to-pointwise bridge via `eow_adj_swap_extension`.

/-- Local commutativity of W_analytic at spacelike-separated boundary points.

    At real points where consecutive arguments are spacelike separated
    (Minkowski norm > 0), swapping those arguments doesn't change the boundary
    value. This follows from `analytic_boundary_local_commutativity` applied to
    the analytic continuation from `spectrum_condition`.

/-- The BHW extension of W_analytic from the forward tube to the permuted extended tube.

    Proved by applying the `bargmann_hall_wightman` axiom (AnalyticContinuation.lean) to
    the holomorphic extension `W_analytic` from `spectrum_condition`, with:
    - Lorentz invariance from `W_analytic_lorentz_on_tube`
    - Continuous boundary values from `W_analytic_continuous_boundary`
    - Local commutativity from `W_analytic_local_commutativity`
