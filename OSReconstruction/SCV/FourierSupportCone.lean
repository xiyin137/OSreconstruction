# Fourier Support in Dual Cones

This file defines `HasFourierSupportInDualCone`, the multi-dimensional generalization
of `HasOneSidedFourierSupport` from `PaleyWiener.lean`. A tempered distribution T
has Fourier support in the dual cone C* if T vanishes on all Schwartz test functions
whose Fourier transform is supported outside C*.

The main theorem `fourierSupportInDualCone_of_tube_boundaryValue` shows that
the distributional boundary value of a tube-holomorphic function with tempered BV
has Fourier support in the dual cone.

## Status

This file contains the Fourier-support predicate and elementary cone lemmas used
by the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz development. The full theorem
`fourierSupportInDualCone_of_tube_boundaryValue` is currently postulated as an
interface theorem: its honest proof needs the Phase 3 Fourier-Laplace bridge,
not just the boundary-value statement in this file.

/-! ### Dual cone for flat types -/

/-- The dual cone of a set S ⊆ ℝ^m using the standard dot product on `Fin m → ℝ`.
    This is the flat-type version of `DualConeEucl`, compatible with `SchwartzMap`
    and `fourierTransformCLM` which use `Fin m → ℝ` (not `EuclideanSpace`). -/

  {ξ | ∀ y ∈ S, (0 : ℝ) ≤ ∑ i, y i * ξ i}

/-! ### Fourier support predicate -/

/-- A tempered distribution `T` has Fourier support in a closed set `S` if
    `T` vanishes on all Schwartz test functions whose support is disjoint from `S`.

    More precisely: for every φ ∈ S(ℝ^m) with `supp(φ) ∩ S = ∅`, we have `T(φ) = 0`.

    This is the "frequency-side" version: `T` is the Fourier transform of the
    original distribution, and `S` is the support in frequency space.
    The connection to `fourierTransformCLM` is made in individual theorems,
    not baked into the definition, to avoid `InnerProductSpace` requirements
    on `Fin m → ℝ`. -/

/-! ### Dual cone membership negation -/

/-- If ξ is not in the dual cone of S, there exists y ∈ S with negative pairing.
    This is just the negation of the universal quantifier in the definition. -/

/-! ### Slice functionals -/

/-- The "slice functional" at imaginary part `y ∈ C`: integration of `F(x+iy)` against
    a Schwartz test function. This is well-defined because `F` is holomorphic (hence
    continuous) on the tube interior, and Schwartz functions are integrable. -/

/-! ### The main theorem -/

/-- The distributional boundary value of a holomorphic function on a tube domain
    over an open convex cone has Fourier support in the dual cone.

    This is the forward direction of the Vladimirov characterization:
    tube-holomorphic + tempered BV → Fourier support in C*.

    The honest proof does not come from the naive scalarized slice functional
    alone: it requires the Phase 3 Paley-Wiener-Schwartz bridge identifying the
    tube-holomorphic function with a Fourier-Laplace transform of its boundary
    value, and then reading off the Fourier support from that representation.
    We therefore keep this as an interface axiom until that infrastructure is
    imported here. -/
